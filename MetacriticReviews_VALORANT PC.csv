0,Anonymous,19-May-21,3,The client is very bad.I have to open the app 3 times so my mouse doesn't get locked on the screen.Rare times i open the game and it shows me offline.But the mouse thing is really annoying...
1,Anonymous,13-May-21,0,"This community is just as if not more toxic than LoL and CSGO. The servers are woefully inconsistent, and spray patterns are laughable. How people main this game will forever elude me. I would give it a negative score if I could."
2,Anonymous,09-May-21,0,Much worst than cs go and overwatch by the way dont forget toxic community 1 more dud game from riot
3,Anonymous,08-May-21,9,The best online fps game ever.I have played Cs Go and Apex Legends but didn't enjoy them very much.I like this game a lot.Especially playing with friends is so fun.
4,Anonymous,06-May-21,0,Mediocre comp game. I mean if you solo queue and fight a five stack thats a joke of ranking system.
8,Anonymous,01-May-21,0,Not worth playing. This game is all about luck and can make your day bad. Many glitches and hacks. Creators hungry for money. Broken ranking system.
9,Anonymous,01-May-21,1,At least cs offers u decent teammates but valorant devs just want to watch the world burn by giving u super bad teammates. 3 words: counter-strike rip off
10,Anonymous,29-Apr-21,1,Incredibly bad game. The stability is horrible and the game keeps encountering errors. Since the latest update many people keep getting a 150 ping even tho it was 34 before. All in all very bad game
12,Anonymous,26-Apr-21,0,Imagine running a game where you care more about someone responded to someone telling them to kill themselves by calling them a f@g than the person telling them to kill themselves. Pathetic.
13,Anonymous,26-Apr-21,0,totally useless game. the guns have aim bot in it. the broken Competitive system gives most dissatisfaction.
14,Anonymous,23-Apr-21,0,"why not just play CS:GO?CS:GO has better shooting mechanics, more maps and custom content support.Valorant has easy to use abilities and heroes lifted straight from overwatch."
15,Anonymous,22-Apr-21,9,"Episode 2 ranking system is kinda bad for me and for other players because every time you lose, you lose more RR and that makes me and other players get tired and bored of the competitive match. Instead of grinding back up, it's getting worst but the game is enjoyable, fun and challenging too, it's worth it. It has the best anti-cheat system in tactical FPS games."
16,Anonymous,21-Apr-21,1,"this game is **** you get f*cking banned for being afk, you cant quit the match so you have to go afk if you have something urgent to do, if you quit to desktop the same happens. the only reason i gave it 1 out of 10 its because its better than a few games if it wasnt for that it wouldve gotten a 0"
17,Anonymous,20-Apr-21,1,"WORST MM i ever played. Cheaters, smurfs, afk players. Rank system sucks... You got 25/11/3,  2 afk in your team and lose? -30 rank points, you got same stats and win? +15 points... It's ridiculous! +1 score for short time games."
21,Anonymous,15-Apr-21,0,"RNG gunplay instead of skilled gunplay, too many abilities are similar (smokes and walls), peekers advantage. At least CSGO's gunplay takes skill. Even Fortnite has better gunplay LMAO. Worst mainstream game on the gaming market rn."
22,Anonymous,13-Apr-21,0,"Honestly not worth playing, it's quite boring for an fps. It's too sweaty for the average player. The gun unbalance is laughably bad, there's 3 good guns to use later in the game, and they're not even very fun to use. My suggestion is to go play some other fps game on pc. CSGO, most COD games, most Halo games, and Siege."
29,Anonymous,06-Apr-21,0,"Terrible level shooting: YOU NEED TO STAND UP AND ONLY THEN YOU CAN SHOOT NORMALLY IN 2020, a stolen shooting pattern and CS. Smurfs in matchmaking, promised anticheat will make fun but does not help with chiters"

33,Anonymous,29-Mar-21,1,The gameplay is very terrible and the community is worse than any games I've ever play. Sadly.
35,Anonymous,26-Mar-21,2,"I hate the afk penalty bs because if I go afk for ONE ROUND, i get a afk penalty offense for ""ruining other people's experiences"". I hope that they fix this because if you go afk so many times (like 5 times), then you will get TOTAL GAME BANNED. Gotta love the people working over their in riot games. I HAVE A WEEK BAN BC I HAD TO EAT DINNER LIKE WTF?!?!?!"
37,Anonymous,22-Mar-21,0,**** game needs to fix the comp system losing more then you win needs to also get a grip on the smurfs and pull there balls out. valorent ranking system should have a bigger discouragement on leaving games once leave should delete that account in a comp game
38,Anonymous,21-Mar-21,0,"3 Points:1. I always get chat-banned for no reason.2. New Update: You can't play competitive with a chat ban.3. When you play many games, you get +15 rank points for a win and -30 for a loss, so completely unfair.WHAT A **** GAME"
39,Anonymous,19-Mar-21,1,"Could be nice, but its riots toxic community with a ton of smurfs. Big fat Dislike on this game!"
40,Anonymous,17-Mar-21,0,game about void anticheat that require reboot and cheaters in every game in both teams. and worst match making
42,Anonymous,16-Mar-21,0,"""advanced"" anti cheat works like trash, numerous cheaters, not fun gameplay, trash community"
44,Anonymous,14-Mar-21,0,"Its a competitive game where sprays are RNG and you can jump shot a guy holding the angle. Enough said. Garbage, 0/10."
47,Anonymous,07-Mar-21,2,"Honestly one of the worst AAA games ever made, terrible balancing, horrible maps, one of the work ranking systems ever made, huge smurfing problems and constant connection issues. The game play is decent but all the other problems just ruin the game."
49,Anonymous,02-Mar-21,0,"trash game with trash recoil ,  skill is nothing in this game b-cause of trashhhh recoil and random."
51,Anonymous,26-Feb-21,1,"A boring rip off of CS-GO, feels very dry, terrible map design, slow boring gameplay"
55,Anonymous,18-Feb-21,8,This is my favorite FPS of all time. I like how you can use abilities that are exclusive to a character to give yourself an advantage. I play it very often.
59,Anonymous,14-Feb-21,0,Game sucks_________________________________________________________________
60,Anonymous,14-Feb-21,8,the games just like csgo a good fps shooter.weapons are alright the optimization is pretty good.good to play with friends
62,Anonymous,11-Feb-21,0,WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM GREEN GREEEEEEEEEEN me say ALONE RAMP me say ALONE RAMP
63,Anonymous,08-Feb-21,0,There are a lot of difficulties in the game including run and guning. Even Roblox managed to deal with that issue. But what are we accepting from a csgo coppie with superpowers?
64,Anonymous,08-Feb-21,0,WOrst matchmaking i ever seen in some game....Trash game like every riots game.
69,Anonymous,06-Feb-21,0,"This game is complete trash.It's a low-tier chinese CSGO clone that fails at being fun or original.The characters are bland, the maps are bland, the... EVERYTHING is bland and uninspired.This game was PAINFUL to play (unlike CSGO) and perfectly encapsulates the safe and inoffensive tripe that the CCP is really going for in gaming today. Absolutely forgettable and an easy hard pass."
70,Anonymous,05-Feb-21,6,"csgo for babies. this game doesn't need to exist, and i still have no idea why it does"
71,Anonymous,05-Feb-21,0,The amount they charge for skins is an insult. F2P? No matter. Still an insult. Stay away.
72,Anonymous,04-Feb-21,3,It's CS:GO but worse at everything and microtransactions are 5x the price...
74,Anonymous,02-Feb-21,3,"( platinum 2 Played 150 hours and 1400 hours of CSGO) This game is an unpolished cheap Chinese mobile knockoff of CS. It is the most unenjoyable FPS experience ever made. Reyna is blatantly broken, rifles are **** maps are horribly designed and the movement is clunky and stiff. valorant vs cs is like paladins vs overwatch"
75,Anonymous,02-Feb-21,0,"Valorant is a fun fps game, but competitive gameplay is often ruined by cheaters, and sometimes low ranked players can get queued with much higher ranked players and get totally destroyed. not to mention higher-ranked players creating another account to smurf in lower ranks. The ranking system is totally unfair, which makes competitive gameplay a lot less fun"
76,Anonymous,02-Feb-21,0,this game is so **** it's not even worth downloading the community is toxic as **** the gameplay is horrible it's just a failed ripoff of cs:go this game deserves to ****ing die along with the developers of this ****ty ass game this game is just sad so sad. ****ing degenerates ****s imagine thinking a cs:go style game with powers would be a good idea stupid queers go eat a dick
77,Anonymous,02-Feb-21,0,"Cheap chinese copy of cs go that installs a root kit your pc,the gameplay feels like plastic,the gun shooting is so lame the characters animations are omg not even funny,the graphics are so bad and i get it that this is a competitive and it's not made for graphics but compared to cs go it looks so washed,some abilities let you fly across the map,just a cheap ugly chinese copy."
79,Anonymous,01-Feb-21,6,"valorant has an interesting design, good idea of what shooters can be and a higly anticipated match for a shooter as competitive like csgo so, comparations will be made, great art design, a solid fps foundation, but it falls short in promises such his"
80,Anonymous,31-Jan-21,2,"The one shot-meta in this game is terrible, armor is simply useless and it's a playground for unskilled players to get their one shot kill by camping in corners with an abysmal mobility, doing carries in a ranking game is just straight up garbage, Riot games should stay away from BR games should they tread into that territory in the future."
83,Anonymous,29-Jan-21,0,"Has the worst UI. The game doesn't care about throwers or quiters because it's a free game. These players will join the game and will do everything to ruin it. The UI is poorly made, will crash more often than not."
86,Anonymous,25-Jan-21,9,"Pretty good,its not the same like cs:go or Overwatch .game its very entertain"
87,Anonymous,25-Jan-21,0,Trash Game CS GO>Valorant. Delete this trash game. You have to pay for skins and characters. Trash game.
88,Anonymous,24-Jan-21,0,If your good in fps game don't play this game I am in silver and I get 15+ kills every game so I get bad team m8 are so bad/toxic
89,Anonymous,24-Jan-21,10,"Its like CS:GO, but with a higher focus on competitive gameplay and balance.Its like Overwatch, but with more updates and memorable characters.Riot Games out-does Blizzard and Valve after just 1 year of VALORANT being available publicly.Best shooter that exists to date. Easy to learn and dangerously addictive."
91,Anonymous,15-Jan-21,9,To me the game is really well refine its feels like csgo too and the only flaw of it is the balance which i dont care i hope people will actually do research instead of rating the agme after 1 gam eof valorant
93,Anonymous,14-Jan-21,0,"Plain garbage, bullets never register, trash physics and garbage graphics..one more time riot games shows how trash they are"
95,Anonymous,14-Jan-21,0,In the beginning you have fun ... In the first game ... In the second it becomes stressful to bring a toxic community beyond the famous run and shoot.
96,Anonymous,13-Jan-21,0,one of the worst games ive ever played blatant csgo ripoff that misses all of the charm csgo has dont download also im pretty sure their anticheat is a virus
97,Anonymous,10-Jan-21,0,"valorant is garbage. I never will play this **** . unbalance weapon , broken character skills and hitbox . i review after played 2 games with good K/D/A .I honestly don't see it hitting big as it doesn't seem to have anything unique to stand out."
98,Anonymous,08-Jan-21,0,pls get rid of  valorant penalties valorant forces you to leave and they give you a penalty pls get rid of this and pls let non gpu computers play
100,Anonymous,12-Sep-20,8,"                                Valorant has a high-quality and clean release without any problems. The game will definitely please fans of the competitive FPS genre. The eSports potential of the shooter has only become established over time, and the first tournaments are already planned. However, a high entry threshold requires serious skill training. But this only makes the game more interesting.                            "
102,Anonymous,29-Jul-20,8,"                                Overall, Valorant is a great game to play if you're a fan of first-person shooter strategy games. But it is also something that someone without experience with games like CS:GO can enjoy and pick up quickly. The Agents are, for the most part, balanced, and the planned addition of more should keep the game fresh. The overall style doesn't really land and the sound design needs to be fixed.                            "
106,Anonymous,03-Jan-21,2,"this game gets nothing right, never actually punishes wrongdoers in the game such as hackers and smurfers so its impossible to rank up no matter how much times i report it riot wouldnt care how bout letting only 1 account per device PLEASE im tired of this nonsense"
112,Anonymous,26-Dec-20,0,"As with Riot's other games, they do nothing to discourage leaving during non-competitive play, therefore your initial experience with the game will be imbalanced teams plagued by disconnects and leaves on either side.One wonders why they fail to address such a simple issue with some system of deincentivization."
114,Anonymous,25-Dec-20,0,"So I've been a competitive  fps guy for more than 6 years and i love cs go but why do it hate valorant so much. every time i get into a match the game mechanics just pisses me off. doesn't happen in csgo. So i came here, made an account to rate this broken game once in for all before i shift deleted the crap  fest."
117,Anonymous,24-Dec-20,2,"If you want to play a game that will give you a headache because the opposite team is full of smurfs and cheaters, this is a game for you. Ranking system, matchmaking, servers, frequent nerfs and buffs  slow gameplay, fps drops, high ping, etc. I hate this game."
119,Anonymous,22-Dec-20,5,"Not gonna lie this game is pretty **** for one that is just copy and pasting csgo gamplay.the movement feels very clunky, the guns dont match with the game and its just boring overall they. and the game is unfinished they released it early which was a mistake cause its definitally notfinished and overall just a bad game"
122,Anonymous,16-Dec-20,10,"A faSciNatInG Game, 5 vs 5 multiplayer Fps Game ..Solid and definitely has an audience. There could be some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun."

129,Anonymous,12-Dec-20,0,Audio effect - **** you can't know where enemy. Graphics - **** spray pattern - **** Physics - ****
133,Anonymous,04-Dec-20,0,Boring. Rush A or B. Plant/Defuse. Rinse and repeat but now you have skills. Can't even get past the half time mark without getting bored. The TTK is just plain bad. The first one who shoots wins. I am not a fan of tactical shooter games anyways so meh. Deathmatch is kinda fun but again the TTK of the game is trash so it dies fast too.
136,Anonymous,28-Nov-20,3,"The game looks cartoonish with slowest and the longest matches 42 mins with other problems as well. Matchmaking are nightmare in a competitive, bad agents design and abilities, game need more maps with descent level design, shop items are more expensive then new cyberpunk game , hitboxes never registered when u got clean headshots, sometimes feel like playing luck base game."
137,Anonymous,26-Nov-20,8,"new update... im back because my friend playfeeling fast now.. its worth to play i change my mind. thanksFeeling slow and bored . Graphic is good but game play is bad . Not worth it to play . I like csgo , apex , and call of duty  . Those are good than Valorant ."
140,Anonymous,22-Nov-20,3,"point blank in 2008 was better than this. if you have a weak computer and you play exclusively competitive shooters, then this is a good game(maybe) ,but i will never recom this to you,better to play cs go on low settings"
141,Anonymous,22-Nov-20,0,Probably the most toxic game ever. Freezes every other second even with decent specs and many people on reddit are frustrated of it. Waste of time.
142,Anonymous,18-Nov-20,9,"Good First Person Shooter for 5 vs 5, the only negative is Optimization. well, if you don't pay attention to this, then the game is good"
143,Anonymous,18-Nov-20,0,"Lag is unbearable in most of the lobbies I have found.  Plenty of hackers, even though Riot requires I launch their useless anticheat.  Really just a money grab for people stupid enough to purchase skins."
144,Anonymous,17-Nov-20,0,this game is for doo doo babies who dont know how to do anything except jerk off to hentai and camp in the corner with a sniper rifle. 0/10 i'm gonna go **** my pants
145,Anonymous,14-Nov-20,7,I think that this is truly a unique game and I would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then I think you should give this game a try.
146,Anonymous,14-Nov-20,3,"Just an empty game with terrible matchmaking, smurfs everywhere, and apparently no punishments for toxic players and leavers. Store prices for skins are STUPID high... we are talking $80 for a few skins. Cringy voice-lines, no storyline, completely unfinished and amazingly low quality for a company like riot games."
148,Anonymous,11-Nov-20,0,"this game is for **** who like to hide and backstab, thought its full of potential but instead its full of ****"
151,Anonymous,08-Nov-20,10,"Valorant (2020) - It's famous, cool, clone Overwatch (2016) and CS:GO (2012), i'm like this game!"
152,Anonymous,07-Nov-20,9,"Such a fun and loveable game I had a blast when I played the game yesterday i love it.What i specificaly like is the agents in valorant, that's the best way and competitive gameplay."
154,Anonymous,04-Nov-20,8,"It is an enjoyable and innovating game , however, the map design is really bad, which suddenly kills the ""fast-paced"" part of the game. The maps also feel way too ""Defender-sided"". There are also some really common glitches and bugs that Riot Games fails to address.Pros : Fun, easy to learn (?), creativeCons : Bad maps, bugs, some (small) balancing issues"
155,Anonymous,04-Nov-20,10,"Fun competitive shooter with many interesting characters. I'm personally not a big fan of the graphics style, but the gameplay makes up for it! Definately give it a shot if you want to play a fun shooter with your friends!"
157,Anonymous,02-Nov-20,2,"generally a good idea, and a pretty good game. But it's hit the point where cheating is just happening too often, and their anti-cheat software isn't worth crap."
159,Anonymous,01-Nov-20,2,"This game could be good but it is not because of riots laziness, the skins cost two AAA games worth of money and it is unbearable how many people are cheating even with this stupid vanguard in place.... Only play if you are in a full team otherwise it is really boring."
161,Anonymous,30-Oct-20,2,Crashes all the time. Otherwise okay but crashes make it frustrating to play.
164,Anonymous,25-Oct-20,10,"For me Valorant is can is good alternative of CS:GO, that game has potential, it's great shooter, yeah maybe some details are not good, but Valorant still can be good game, that will compare to CS:GO"
165,Anonymous,20-Oct-20,0,"The shooting mechanics are difficult to use, especially for players with a TF2 and Overwatch background, which the game seems to target. The shooting mechanic also favors camping (Staying in one spot all game while shooting passing enemies) which is frowned upon in most games. The heavy armor does next to nothing. And there are some buggy aspects to the game.."
166,Anonymous,20-Oct-20,4,"Counter Strike for Mobile Phones. It is a simplistic and more simplified version of CS GO. Game feels clunky and has no speed factor. Shooting in the head is easier. Hero skills are nice and is really great innovation, but overall it is boring to play and watch. Monetisation model is horrible and over the top!"
167,Anonymous,20-Oct-20,8,"Awesome game that has been undermined.Three features:Fast-paced, Action-packed, QualityGetting less than 60 pings in Asia, Hell Yeah"
168,Anonymous,19-Oct-20,0,"for brain dead people, who can't play counterstrike. common a slow FPS game?"
169,Anonymous,17-Oct-20,0,"This is the worst piece of trash game I have ever played. Buggy, will not even load at times! Unbalanced, with smurfs and cheaters galore. Do not waste your valuable time."
172,Anonymous,14-Oct-20,0,"Valorant is slow, boring, too sweaty, and unfinished. It came out way to rushed and never came close to CSGO polish. Sad that people defend this when CSGO clearly won the battle with constantly double the amount of streams on compared to Valorant. Also Riot games is known for making frustrating content and this is no exception."
173,Anonymous,12-Oct-20,0,"Movement is very clunkly. No ADS when using pistols. Characters are imbalanced. Cheaters are dominating. Only 3 maps. $100 skins, talk about a cash grab. This game plays more like an alpha build than anything. There are just to many other games out there that play better than this game."
179,Anonymous,01-Oct-20,4,"Valorant is a quite interesting game. Fun to play with friends. Overall not bad. But their store system is completely trash. You can't buy favorite skin just because their revenue 'GENIUS' decided to rotate their store and you never know when your favorite skin will appear. Riot did all the hard work to make a good game with a very trash store . Sad ,very sad."
181,Anonymous,27-Sep-20,1,This game has as many cheater as cs:go with their vanguard anti cheat to make things worse just a day after their patch almost more than 1 in every match has cheaters

187,Anonymous,23-Sep-20,0,"The game has a terrible ranked system just from the ground up You can win ten games not rank up and have one bad game and get de-ranked. It seems like the game is going to get stale after a year. CS:GO fans will have more luck sticking to CS, Valorant is a mess. Not worth giving a chance."
189,Anonymous,21-Sep-20,5,"Poor copy of csgo, 0 awards for grinding ranks, avg performance, only 3 maps."
191,Anonymous,20-Sep-20,0,Full of smurfers and stupid weapons like the odin... I enjoyed it in s1 but in s2 its unplayable. Just pay2win with the ugly skins.
193,Anonymous,16-Sep-20,1,"this is the worst ever shooter of all time, there is so much imbalance and nonsense, it's just kaets. It feels like the developers just don't care about the game, no patches, there is simply no balancing ability, no one looks at the statistics to watch what is not so easy, everyone does not care"
194,Anonymous,13-Sep-20,9,"i really enjoy this game. Valorant has an interting desingn and good gameplay. But one thing I don't like is that when I exited the game I was banned for 4 hours, which was extremely annoying"
195,Anonymous,12-Sep-20,8,nice fps game graphics nice best for me good cheat protection cs better but cheat protection disgrace we have to play it
196,Anonymous,11-Sep-20,1,this game is a **** bias as son of a **** if you spent money on the game it will give you lesser recoil and if you don't the will give you opponent that is much higher elo then you and they will also **** up you recoil if you are ranking up to fast
200,Anonymous,10-Sep-20,6,Valorant is a fun game to play with multiple characters and you can use tons of guns. I do think it seams unfinished 1. there is not enough stages 2. there is no character skins 3. there is not enough original aspects. It is a fun game to play a bit on your free time but it is not mind blowing.
201,Anonymous,09-Sep-20,0,"One of the worst fps game, I have ever played"
206,Anonymous,08-Sep-20,0,its honestly an overwatch and cs go mashup its empty it lacks movement and content its like a recycled game its like they just took it from the trash and presented it . I never liked apex but i might give it a second chance because it felt a little different.
207,Anonymous,08-Sep-20,0,yes riot games are just copy pasta devs aiming to squeeze as much as they can from their players to please their communist chinese overlord.
209,Anonymous,06-Sep-20,10,"like cs but without all the cheaters and toxicity, and brings an updated feel to the fps genre."
211,Anonymous,05-Sep-20,0,It's a good game but the penalties are dumb as heck! 1-hour c'mon man. They also need to balance characters and don't even think about the microtransactions.
214,Anonymous,04-Sep-20,0,"If you're in Solo Queue, goodluck having good Rank. They will queue you up with no-gamesense players. Full of bugs but updated skins. They do not focus fixing their game, they focus on charging your wallet"
215,Anonymous,04-Sep-20,3,It is one of the best Free2Play Games but it has a hughe Cheater Problem like the most other games. So i cannot recommend it.
216,Anonymous,02-Sep-20,0,"It's just awful.The game is slow and boring, not much content,  you will spend way more time waiting for the matches and walking around to find someone than actually playing. The game feels completely empty and a waste of time."

218,Anonymous,31-Aug-20,0,"You shoot in one spot, bullet are around, not even near where you shooting. Report system doesn't work at all. Deathmatch burn your computer, even if you play in Tesla's office. Worst game ever, as always, Ritogames. 10000% deservse to call RELIASED GAME (no)."
222,Anonymous,27-Aug-20,10,I love valorant but most of the reviews are really biased because of CS:GO. Most people play two games then say the game is bad but once you play and get decent the game becomes extremely fun. This game gets extremely fun when you are in a 1v5 and your Adrenalin starts pumping and you ace. THIS GAME IS GREAT
223,Anonymous,27-Aug-20,0,bro this game is absolute dog. the bullet spray is rigged and trying to rank up while being a silver player is like trying to compete against  multiple shrouds.
230,Anonymous,22-Aug-20,10,feels different and fresh.i like how they took the csgo style and added their own flavor to it.
231,Anonymous,22-Aug-20,6,Just a less fun csgo / just a less fun Overwatch. There's not much else to say
232,Anonymous,21-Aug-20,3,"1. Toxic community2. Can't choose maps3. Strange matchmaking and ranking system4. Overpriced skinsGenerally, the game is boring unless you play it with friends."
238,Anonymous,18-Aug-20,10,In my opinion it's way more fun to play than csgo. I love the characters' unique abilities and voiceovers. I hope the content keeps rolling out with more and more maps and characters. I hope the game stays alive for a long time.
240,Anonymous,17-Aug-20,0,"Holy moly...  Another garbage mess of a game Riot fails to execute properly.  Server/client aiming bugs, hitbox registration issues and MASSIVE client bugs.  Friendly verison or CS:GO with elements of over watch, Riot manages to STILL butcher a copycat design.  It's amazing this studio is still in business..."
244,Anonymous,16-Aug-20,0,the game is fun idk why alot of people hate it its 1 of the best games ive played in 2020
245,Anonymous,16-Aug-20,0,Valorant is another multiplayer only game which to me is the definition of insanity which I won't subject myself to wasting money on to play
247,Anonymous,15-Aug-20,0,"Stoopid game full of toxic player and troll , the game mechanic is just stoopid  you can't shoot accurate when Walking and crouch move ?? WTF Even in Csgo you can Crouch and move when shooting with good accuracy"
249,Anonymous,15-Aug-20,0,Pretty dull and boring game. Useless powers and zero recoil. Graphics are very bland and does not appeal. I did not like this game much.
251,Anonymous,14-Aug-20,10,valorant jest smiesnzy i w sumie jest badziewny hehebede sie modlil za ich dewelporeowamen
253,Anonymous,12-Aug-20,0,This game is slow as it can get after i buy go to site i have to wait another 20 sec the gameplay is boring if you don't want to camp this game is not for you honestly if i camped more i would get more kills and thats boring af
255,Anonymous,09-Aug-20,0,"VALORANT is Over hyped ,Overrated,Unbalanced,Fortnite+CS+over watch, i played for 3 days just to check what all the hype is about.AND YES CS IS STILL BETTER !"
256,Anonymous,09-Aug-20,0,Just play CSGO instead its better lmao. CSGO has better gunplay more maps and less 12 year old's
259,Anonymous,09-Aug-20,0,"I had played the game when it was I'm Beta, frankly it looked pretty **** and was praying for good mechanics, but it was seriously broken for the spectre and the phantom"
262,Anonymous,08-Aug-20,7,"Man, This game is great and addicting but **** me i hate it. I played 5 rounds of comp and finally got promoted, only to lose it after one lose. If they fixed this it has potential to be a good game.SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIKE"
263,Anonymous,08-Aug-20,0,The game play doesn't feel exciting at all and the community is toxic it could even be worse than fortnite
266,Anonymous,06-Aug-20,0,"Game graphics worse than the 2009 game, gun sounds like shooting BB bullets, a sloppy world view of superpowers shooting, a dumb rank matchmaking system, etc."
269,Anonymous,04-Aug-20,0,Ranking system is one of the worst I have ever seen. Anti cheat is extremely intrusive and also extremely useless. Not as a joke it is an actual chinese rip off of counter strike. I have seen better mobile FPS games than this.
270,Anonymous,04-Aug-20,0,Copy CSGO mixed with Apex legend literally out date game released in 2020. BTW be careful with the Chinese malware
274,Anonymous,03-Aug-20,1,"How to explain it in a nutshell. Besides that the details of the game leave to be desired. It adds a toxic community +a great chance to find people who use cheats. Riot tried to expand into another market, but he has a lot of work to do before he makes Valuable a pleasant game to play."
276,Anonymous,03-Aug-20,0,"The game is full of smurfs. It is unplayable and you are literally f*cked from match 1. The worst matchmaking I have ever seen and the game is balanced as sh*t. Not recommended. Pure cancer game. You might enjoy 5-10 matches but then the game gets frustrating, annoying and pathetic."
279,Anonymous,03-Aug-20,2,"I don't recommend valorant. A lot of HUD problems, assist count is not valuable, etc."
280,Anonymous,03-Aug-20,0,"Valorant really does not stand out with other FPS games in the same category, while it was released later that the gameplay and systems are not too special to be a game icon. Slow, boring, smooth but somehow bulky, guns feel eye-catching are words to describe Valorant."
283,Anonymous,02-Aug-20,0,Literally don't waste your time playing thus game. The skins are all overpriced and their rank system is so garbage.
284,Anonymous,02-Aug-20,1,Just an overwatch ripoff essentially. Nothing new or exciting and hardly fun to enjoy
287,Anonymous,01-Aug-20,3,"trash servers 2 placement games were ruined because I kept on disconnecting for the first 4 rounds other games like overwatch, apex, and Minecraft didn't have this issue"
288,Anonymous,01-Aug-20,10,This game has the potential to totally eradicate csgo. Kids grow up and accept a good game instead of comparing.
293,Anonymous,30-Jul-20,0,"BUllet registraion makes me want to jump off a building. Machmaking was designed by a toddler at mcdonalds, Raze n Purple girl or broken and ruin the games design."
294,Anonymous,30-Jul-20,4,"The game has some potential, but for the time it gets boring real fast, even if you are playing ranked. You dont get the feeling of teamplay like you do in CS:GO for example. Another major critic is the map design and the mm. I feel like the maps could be so much better, with more details, cover and so on."
295,Anonymous,29-Jul-20,0,"I'm not a cheater and never be, i was banned and I don't even understand why! I wrote in support, they said that this is forever... Well, maybe in this way you can ban real cheaters... The support service in my country is not working properly! I love Riot Games with all my heart, but Valorant... Banned forever for fair play and love for riot games."
302,Anonymous,27-Jul-20,9,"This game is pretty good, besides the fact that its Camping In Corners: The Videogame. It's a less toxic version of CS:GO and takes inspiration from Overwatch. Play this and you wont be dissapointed."
303,Anonymous,26-Jul-20,6,"This game is nice. Riot had good idea to create this game and they did it well but community is BAD, 1 on 3 rankeds, people are toxic or they don't speak and write on chat. If community were nice, I would give 8 but they aren't nice so I give 6."
305,Anonymous,25-Jul-20,0,"I dont like Counter Strike, but this is a bad copy of Counter Strike, with a little of overwatch to say it's not a copy. Riot Games is doing the only thing they know: a bad copy of existing games"
309,Anonymous,25-Jul-20,0,This game is a total rip-off and I cannot stress enough about how this game's ping system sucks. Thanks.
310,Anonymous,24-Jul-20,10,good game I loved it cause I lived csgo and rainbow six siege and the art style oh my god I loved the art style I recommend u to play these game it's free!
311,Anonymous,23-Jul-20,0,THis game is awesome...and is clearly the next big Esports title...decent in game mechanics and super fun gameplay...its a perfect choice for this quarantine situation
312,Anonymous,23-Jul-20,0,Just came here to drop a bomb. And I never play this game just want you to know that riot games sucks ass. And stupid graphics nah I just wanna bomb this game sorry guys
313,Anonymous,23-Jul-20,10,"Honestly an amazing game, its an upgrade to CSGO in almost or every single way, but its a new game so you will expect some unbalanced things and maps that need to be retouched to be ""simpler"". currently valorant is going through an ""OP"" meta where everyone is using the sniper since its really strong in this game but it should be good once its nerfed."
314,Anonymous,23-Jul-20,0,"Random bullet deviation should never be a part of a first person shooter that relies on accuracy of your shots, EVER. Same issue in BF1, your aim can be on point, but if RNG magically decides your bullets aren't going to hit, you're not going to hit. Imo, don't even bother with the game."
327,Anonymous,20-Jul-20,2,"Bad texture , not optimized , the game is slow , maps are very linear , it's no longer fun after 10 games (or less). I'm just disappointed with the game. CSGO and Overwatch are way better than this game"
331,Anonymous,19-Jul-20,0,"The ban system and the support is UNFFAIR. If you want a shooter go to CSGO, PUBG, APEX LEGENDS, ETC. Valorant and RIOT are Crap"
332,Anonymous,19-Jul-20,2,"Great tutorial and that's about it. Anti-cheat needs root/ kernel access. The game is a poor mixture of csgo and overwatch. I don't think it knows what is wants to be, but could be better in the future. I think all the positive reviews are likely bought and paid for by tencent."
333,Anonymous,19-Jul-20,0,Fine game destroyed by microtransacions and preying on people with some amounts of money and no control in order to get them to spend thousands without even noticing
335,Anonymous,19-Jul-20,0,"It's cool, but..Too Invasive AC game. The sound detector on steps is exagereble. There are so many child players in the game.  is massive to improve xp in the game. All is to expensive."
337,Anonymous,19-Jul-20,0,"Laggy servers, pathetic matchmaking, Unfair match. Basically a ripoff of some games"
338,Anonymous,19-Jul-20,3,"Feels like a weird mix of Team Fortress 2, Overwatch and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. The gameplay is very much feels like the previously mentioned games but sadly that's it. The game brings nothing new to the table and the fact that the graphics looks like a mobile game makes this a bad shooter."
343,Anonymous,18-Jul-20,3,Played my first match and got screamed at by the same toxic players that inhabit League. Glad to see they made the switch. The matches take too long to play and they are boring and repetitive. The guns all feel the same. Why can't I aim down my sights with certain guns?
345,Anonymous,17-Jul-20,10,"interesting game play and need a high tactical, especially I like the graphics of the game. you need to try it!"
348,Anonymous,16-Jul-20,6,"Plain Copy of Csgo,don't see any reason why it should be considered good at all"
349,Anonymous,15-Jul-20,3,"not great, it has a lot of problems and i have very high ping which i don't in other games."
350,Anonymous,15-Jul-20,1,"Feels like CSGO with Fortnite graphics.................. ""to fill the requirements""........................"
352,Anonymous,14-Jul-20,0,"The game didn't open, after loggin in I hear an Windows error and the game does not open, totally awful"
359,Anonymous,13-Jul-20,0,"The worst in-game store in online games that exists. Players who bought a set in beta are now gathering dust in the game currency. Talking about unstable servers and terrible optimization of the game does not even make sense. The game had potential, but the developers seem to regard it as a one-day project for making money."
364,Anonymous,11-Jul-20,1,Could be a very good game but it's horrible! hit reg and desync are outrageous. Every round you die and then you see the enemy or you shoot in the head (clearly you see and hear the bullet hitting the head) and if you are lucky you got leg reg. this game is already dead! A shooter that doesn't shoot! Surely developers are very busy making skins and sell them for 100$. Well done!!!!!!!!!!!
368,Anonymous,11-Jul-20,3,Game is decent nothing special but the Shop is pure Scam.wont stop the dumb sheeps to buy everything i think....but if you hate Last of us 2 i cant take you serious for not hating this....
369,Anonymous,10-Jul-20,1,The customization is nothing hut a cash grab.  20 to 50 and even 95 dollar skins ? I will never give a game a positive score when ur charging that much for skins. Not maps and different game variations but just Skins 
371,Anonymous,10-Jul-20,0,a way better than cs but it should be in beta still. atm its literally unplayable
374,Anonymous,09-Jul-20,3,"At the beggining i started enjoying this game a lot. But after playing a lot of hours i have ended hating it. Very toxic players in every match and the matchmaking is completely broken, unless you play with your friends its a very frustrating game. Last 10 matches lost 2-13 moreless"
377,Anonymous,08-Jul-20,0,This game is trash 10 times worse than CS GO it has **** balance **** servers everything is **** about that game
378,Anonymous,08-Jul-20,7,The game is okay but less competitive environment. The character and the abilities makes the game special. I will recommend this game.
379,Anonymous,08-Jul-20,7,"Personally, I think the game is good and has potential, but it's a little boring."
380,Anonymous,07-Jul-20,6,"Fun, but FPS experience lags compared to other games in the space and the gameplay feel is off."
382,Anonymous,06-Jul-20,0,"boring,unskilled,unbalanced. In 2 years its gonna be dead. It feels like a mobile game"
383,Anonymous,06-Jul-20,0,"The game is already spoiled by cheaters, Riot is not enough reactive. It's nearly impossible to have a decent match-up !"
386,Anonymous,06-Jul-20,0,"Got pretty hooked for 3 days, could have played more but cheaters already ruined it for me. No chance to Vote-Kick a cheater, anticheat is not working. Cheating bastards just loling at you on chat that they never got banned. Also flooded with kids from other games who just call you a noob or and idiot on voice chat with no reason. Good game tho but ruined with 0/10 community."
387,Anonymous,06-Jul-20,4,"Slow, clunky and not that much fun. Maps are small and confined and while the abilities are nice enough, it doesn't help much on the overall feel of the game. If you want an ability driven game, there is Overwatch. If you want a tactical shooter, there's Rainbow Six. Valorant tries to be a tactical ability shooter, and ends up falling short on everything."
388,Anonymous,06-Jul-20,0,"I have never, never been so much tilted in my life. The game is designed to constantly make your life hell. And I gave it a a try - 50 hours of game-play. I was a CS-GO player once, it is really similar. Despite the fact it is the least enjoyable game I have ever played. I can understand why so many people like it."
389,Anonymous,06-Jul-20,0,This is not better than CS its just a easy and trash version of CS I'm glad its free to play but its so trash. If you are in asia you will get to play with australia very laggy trash
392,Anonymous,05-Jul-20,1,"The gameplay is very slow. When you run, you're being heard from another part of the Universe. So you should always walk to not being very vulnerable.Everyone hits with headshots all the time. Where are all that skillful aimers in another FPS?Cheaters! CS have these too, but Valve has a huge experience dealing with them.This game is CS of a smoker.OK graphics and performance, though."
395,Anonymous,04-Jul-20,10,"Valorant is not bad at all it's fun to play.The problem here is VAC, it's will make ur computer and the other games get effect"
401,Anonymous,02-Jul-20,0,This is the most uncreative game I have ever it is somewhat fun because it is cs go rip off but you can see that there was no effort put into the making of this game I admit that you will have a bit of fun but supporting rip offs like this just because they are made by a rich company with great marketing. Its overall an ok game but you can probably find something better.
404,Anonymous,01-Jul-20,5,"over hyped, game was fun at the start but now its just getting dull. every new update is just tweaks to characters and sometimes map changes, nothing interesting at all. hit reg is weird and ping problems are a thing, game play feels a bit clunky and when you get a a kill it doesn't feel like an award"
408,Anonymous,30-Jun-20,5,"You must always have the Vanguard open if it does not ask you to restart the PC. Unbalanced agents in my opinion, which makes the game long without being able to balance the teams"
412,Anonymous,29-Jun-20,0,Seems like a rip-off counter-strike of poor quality. I honestly don't see it hitting big as it doesn't seem to have anything unique to stand out.
416,Anonymous,29-Jun-20,2,"A unimaginative CSGO / OVERWATCH clone with **** mobile graphics.  slow mechanics and gameplay, a complete snooze fest 2bh. 2/10"

424,Anonymous,28-Jun-20,0,Good but CS better.Its like CSGO+OVERWATCH+R6S=VALORANT.It is not very fun to play to be honest.Every map is the same.Textures are same on every map.
426,Anonymous,27-Jun-20,1,"Bad graphic, stolen gameplay presets from cs:go (same guns, same game mech). High tickrate but gamedevs does not use it, game too slow. Maps have a lot corridors, look like some old mp f2p shooter.  Seen some cheaters. So this is not a game by big dev company, i really dont know why Riot release something like that"
427,Anonymous,27-Jun-20,1,All Riot do was copy Overwatch and Cs:Go. Mashed them together and somehow **** it up so bad that i rather play Mighty No 9.
428,Anonymous,27-Jun-20,5,More toxic than CS. Plays like a worse version with shoehorned in Overwatch skills. Much better ways to spend your time.
430,Anonymous,27-Jun-20,7,Classic 5v5 competitive shooter. Feels kinda casual and like a mix of counter strike and overwatch. It's good for what it wants to be but not groundbreaking. Some bugs and the weird hitboxes can be frustrating. The maps feel balanced although there are other games which do alot better.
431,Anonymous,27-Jun-20,0,"Valorant is literally just lower quality Paladins, where as Paladins is literally just a lower quality overwatch. There is absolutely no originality or innovation in this copy and paste, money grab of a game."
432,Anonymous,26-Jun-20,8,"not bad for a cs go variant. Enjoyable characters and gameplay but some of the characters are SOOOO op it makes it hard to flourish unless you use them, so .. follow the current meta boiz."
436,Anonymous,26-Jun-20,4,trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash
437,Anonymous,26-Jun-20,8,"Valorant is a very good move forward from CS:GO, the bright color pallet and the simple yet intuitive graphics along with the solid gameplay makes it very addictive and fun to play.There is definitely room to grow and improve/balance the game but overall it's a very good game that everyone should play (If they are into hyper competitive and tactical shooters that is)."
443,Anonymous,25-Jun-20,0,yeah this game doesnt deser a point people from cs in enemy team in my team paladins players report? for what? they dont even review it afk YES WE GOT THAT TOO palawatchgo (paladins overwatch cs) i prefer play free frire than this
444,Anonymous,25-Jun-20,2,It would be quite fun if it wasnt for the fact that any solo queue experience - ranked or not is akin to stabbing yourself in the eyeball with an aids ridden rusty fork.  It is more toxic than any experience one might have in League at any point - not even joking. So stay FAR FAR away unless you have an entire squad or are into ultra hardcore bdsm.
445,Anonymous,25-Jun-20,0,"Frick the Hitboxes, frick the corners, and frick the stupid abilities . Was fun but then I realized ""hey, what if I played a good game?"" then went and played literally anything else. Frick you Valorant."
446,Anonymous,25-Jun-20,0,0 for toxic advertising. I watch the same non-skipable Valorant ad at least 3 times each hour. **** you.
448,Anonymous,25-Jun-20,0,Game itself is good enough but no Surround sound and Ultrawide support in 2020?  not acceptable
450,Anonymous,24-Jun-20,0,"I got 9 ads in a row for this game while watching anime. Not like got the ad watched a few minutes of the show and got the same ad. No, I got 9 of the same ad. Will not be playing."
452,Anonymous,24-Jun-20,5,"i think this game started on the wrong foot, having an anti-cheat, the possibility to shoot through walls requires the player to need a killcam in my opinion, also the fact that it is full of bots that do not answer, and, in my opinion, full of cheater too."
453,Anonymous,24-Jun-20,1,"Do you like horrible mobile style graphics? How about a non existent story? Well if you like those things, plus ugly vision blocking effects in a cheap ripoff of other popular hero shooters Valorant is for you! If you combine that with micro transactions it is the perfect storm for a Chinese clone of previous western titles. I"
455,Anonymous,23-Jun-20,4,"It's mediocre af, basically babies' first Counter Strike. Movement too slow, abilities too braindead, and maps are too **** for it to ever truly compete with CS though."
456,Anonymous,23-Jun-20,7,"It's good, yet frustrating. The other players are so much better than I am and the game can be toxic because of how much I suck.There are also some REALLY young children on voice chat, and I don't think the game is age appropriate.The heroes are varied and fun to play and overall I recommend it."
457,Anonymous,23-Jun-20,0,"The idea is csgo+overwatch but the problem is that game feels like slow, for example, the operator is very very slow and bad. It's like a Chinese copy of csgo but with things that kill for u (powers)"
458,Anonymous,23-Jun-20,2,"half-cs, half-overwatch, downgrate textures, unleavened chars, and over9000lvl marketing = valorant.critics didnt play another fps? why 80, its ridiculous"
459,Anonymous,23-Jun-20,9,This is a very nice FPS game. I had a very enjoyable time. Playing with friends it is more enjoyable.
461,Anonymous,23-Jun-20,10,Riot outdid themselves on this one. The agents are very view but how well the mechanics work together makes it fun to play.I definitely expect the meta to shift around like in lol but the cs like mechanics make it easy to pick up again for a while after a break.Obviously this genre got nothing much new but it still feels fresh enough to be fun and appealing!
465,Anonymous,22-Jun-20,0,The graphical aspect of the game is poor for me the graphical aspect is that it motivates me to play not for 1440p or 4k but rather that it at least looked decent and in a matter of maps it does not finish conversing me.
466,Anonymous,22-Jun-20,0,A GAME ABOUT PRECISION BUT HITBOXES CAN GLITCH OUT WORSE THAN RAINBOW SIX SEIgE
468,Anonymous,22-Jun-20,0,"Unoriginal and boring. This game is for people who don't mind something they've played before, many times over. It's extremely simplistic, and has no real point to playing it. Games are becoming more complex and beautiful. This game goes there exact opposite direction."
469,Anonymous,22-Jun-20,0,"Pure trash, unplayable and very unoptimized game with constant ""Low client fps"" ""High ping"" despite having a decent internet connection (Other games outside SEA server has a pretty stable connection & ping) and a laptop that meets the recommended system requirements. Uninstalled this pure **** trashlorant of a game"
470,Anonymous,22-Jun-20,0,"Quite literally, the most boring FPS I've ever had the displeasure of encountering; and on top of that a Root Kit by a company owned by Tencet. This game will never ever be installed on my PC, ever. Riot as a Dev is a no-go from me from now on."
472,Anonymous,22-Jun-20,1,The anticheat basically ruined my pc disabled my mouse and keyboard bloody apps uninstalled my msi afterburner had to boot up the pc in safe mode to be able to fix this crap no game is worth trashing your pc.GG
474,Anonymous,22-Jun-20,0,No voicechat in Cybersport oriented game. It's just digusting. We can't even coordinate our game
475,Anonymous,22-Jun-20,3,"As someone who've played since beta, game was nowhere near finished release. Random freezes, crashes, DCs happen, and let's not get started on the Vanguard malware. There are only 4 maps and 2 modes which makes it repetitive and tedious when you add the Battle Pass that requires you to play at least 2 hours everyday to finish on top of that."
480,Anonymous,21-Jun-20,8,"The game is really a fresh new take on the tactical fps genre. The weapon are solid and the characters are well designed, maps are ok and the game turns out to be really addicting. The only concern is about Vanguard which should not be running 24/7 as you boot up your pc but only when the game launches."
481,Anonymous,21-Jun-20,0,"Overhyped game. Hitboxes are worse than in csgo. Funny recoil, funny design. Game not for years like CSGO."
482,Anonymous,21-Jun-20,10,"Do not listen to all the negative reviews, they are just frustrated that they are super bad at the game. Its a good game if you like tactical fps gameplay, and prefer tactical gunplay over running and gunning."

489,Anonymous,20-Jun-20,6,"CS go and overwatch mashed together to make this. While it has the best of both worlds combined, hero skills feel unbalanced as some are more impactful than others and the microtransactions are shockingly high priced at a boosted value."
492,Anonymous,20-Jun-20,9,"So fun , it's Like a blend of cs:go and Rainbow six siege with a fun aesthetic . I've only been playing it for the past 2 weeks but i can already say that'll be my main competitive game"
493,Anonymous,20-Jun-20,9,"It is simply a fun tactical fps, where you don't HAVE TO learn every single smoke and practice for hours just to play ranked, but, if you want you have plenty of ways to learn cool tech with characters like sova or viper."
494,Anonymous,20-Jun-20,4,Boring game don't play you waste 2 minutes to buy guns and wait for the round to start then start and is the most boring gun play ever
495,Anonymous,20-Jun-20,10,"Valorant is not original. Rather, it's a successful interpretation of and expansion on its inspirations, with impeccable gameplay, well-designed maps, and a dev team eager to refine it further."
497,Anonymous,20-Jun-20,10,In my opinion the game is great. It's fun to play (especially with friends) but still competitive.I know there are things to be done but they'll fix it / balance it over time.
499,Anonymous,20-Jun-20,4,"The game was good for the first week, then it went on a steady decline. The novelty of it wore off. This game was awesome but now it is terribly average. The ski prices are outrageous as well, $130 for a skin pack? No way."

Not my play style at all but it doesn't run great for the low cartoon poly feeling graphics they used, had to leave my first match due to internet lag.

510,Anonymous,19-Jun-20,0,"There are lots of hackers in this game and Riot, unfortunately, cannot do anything against them."
515,Anonymous,19-Jun-20,4,The game just feels like CS:GO with a hero mechanic from games like Overwatch and Paladins. It doesn't bring anything unique to the table but is instead a mashup of two well established sub genres of the FPS game.
516,Anonymous,19-Jun-20,6,"The game is free and quite fun but doesnt compare to other well known fps games such as Counter Strike Global Offensive or Call of Duty Modern Warfare, both also being free to play in certain aspects."

532,Anonymous,18-Jun-20,10,I do not know what these 0 reviews are smoking but the game is hella fun. Not as punishing as csgo with nice bright graphics and good agents. Only complaint is how expensive skins are.
533,Anonymous,18-Jun-20,7,"I love the game design, not too realistic. There is a potential for making a really interesting lore. However there is a lack of content and 3 maps is quite stingy.."
534,Anonymous,18-Jun-20,0,"Gameplay is antiquated and clunky. I feel like csgo and overwatch a child, with all of the bad genetics passing over and none of the good. Get real, its 2020. Why are you using game mechanics from the early 2000s."
535,Anonymous,17-Jun-20,2,"The anti-cheat is a spyware garbage who cant even do its job and, the netcode has things like peekers advantage that makes the game sometimes unfair and tilting. The game obviously takes concepts from Counter-Strike but lacks gamemodes such as deathmatch or gungame. It only has 4 maps and their desings are begginer level and boring."
536,Anonymous,17-Jun-20,0,Terrible Game released by a terrible company. buggy boring game play don't waste your time with this one. go play csgo.
537,Anonymous,17-Jun-20,0,DONT UNINSTALL THE ANTICHEAT!!! It has bricked my pc for the third and last time. The subreddit for this game is censored just the the chinese government. Funny how riot is owned by tencent(a chinese company). And do some research im not the only one with this issue.
538,Anonymous,17-Jun-20,1,unoriginal and poorly executed. bad experience playing and boring to watch... too bad

545,Anonymous,16-Jun-20,2,"It's just a bad free CS:GO mixed with Overwatch, has a lot bugs and cheaters i don't recommend playing it."
547,Anonymous,15-Jun-20,3,Valorant is fun when you get to play. The problem is playing it. The game tends to crash while in a match and then you get banned for an hour before you can try to play again. Needs patches before it is ready to be played.
548,Anonymous,15-Jun-20,0,It is sooo bad! It keep crashing and disconecting me. It also completly destroyed my audio driver. I just coudnt hear anything while this game was on my pc. Dont play it. That Vanguard **** is a virus for your pc.
549,Anonymous,15-Jun-20,0,"It's the slowest game I have ever played, you have to have the patience of a **** snail and it makes the game the most boring thing in the world, the guns are not balanced, people get way too much value out of"
554,Anonymous,14-Jun-20,9,"A really good FPS, the graphic style is simple, but that makes it even better. Although there are a few bugs, they get regularly patched. The gameplay is very fun. The skins are quite expensive, but the game is free to play."
555,Anonymous,14-Jun-20,10,This game is prolly a 9/10 actually but I'm gonna give it 10/10 cause all the people crying giving it 0's cause they figure out they suck ass at Counter Strike and therefore suck ass at this game and go 0-14 then start crying saying the games bad cause there complete trash and can't figure out how to aim.
557,Anonymous,14-Jun-20,10,"Very cool design, huge fan of almost all the maps, very similar to csgo but differentiates itself from it with its gun play and abilities. super fun to play and would reccommend to anyone looking for a good fps"
559,Anonymous,14-Jun-20,0,"The game isn't feel right. if feel a little bit clunky, sluggish, the gun skin is overpricedZero Point because of the anti-cheat :Vanguard, it give me blue screen LOL"
560,Anonymous,14-Jun-20,9,"Fresh game! I'm tired of every CSGO player who already memorized every spot, smurf account, and etc. For y'all who said this game just copying CS and Overwatch, you just an average player that too comfortable with 1 game and dont want to try another game.."
561,Anonymous,14-Jun-20,4,thIs game is more is **** trash the skill level needed is SO LOW their isnt a point in buting the more expensive weapons because some one could push  with a bucky
562,Anonymous,14-Jun-20,0,"This assessment is due to the terrible quality of the game, full copying and disgusting graphics. And also, by the fact that the developers of this **** support protests in the USA and the BLM (Balck Lives Matter) movement. This game deserves that kind of appreciation, and the developers deserve charity for their actions."
569,Anonymous,13-Jun-20,0,"Game is infested with cheaters. No matter how you play, there will always be a cheater that can destroy you without using any SKILLS. Also the server sucks for most South East Asian players, since it prioritize Japan server and Chinese server instead of giving us an option to select for a certain server."
571,Anonymous,13-Jun-20,3,"the game is raw playing it is very felt, when the developers all the time talked about their consultation with eSports, it immediately became clear that the project will fail and play it will only be those who have weak PCs or children who have not seen anything better"
572,Anonymous,13-Jun-20,0,We are not trolls... This game is bad and seems to be in it for the money. God I hate cancel culture.
577,Anonymous,12-Jun-20,0,The only game I play where I have to play 60fps fixed to avoid latency issues. Just not finished.
578,Anonymous,12-Jun-20,0,"A cheap knockoff of CS:S with minimum effort design choices, uninteresting characters, boring muted color palette, and a glaring lack of creativity when it comes to weapon design. This uninspired Chinese-targeted Esports bait of a game will not be remembered, instead, blissfully forgotten by the community in the coming years."
581,Anonymous,12-Jun-20,4,"Interesting look, but some agents are overpowered, weapons are not satisfying to shoot with, very loooooooooooooooooong and boring matches."

585,Anonymous,11-Jun-20,0,"When I played this game, I felt like I was playing in cheep browser version of CS:GO without original ideas. And special thanks for Riot, they have so much money that they can create the best game in the world, but they won't do it because of greed and their uncontrollable thirst for 'easy' money."
587,Anonymous,11-Jun-20,0,Game seems pretty goodRiots sexual harassment problems are not good Play overwatch

591,Anonymous,11-Jun-20,2,I was expecting much more at the begin because they literally forced us to watch to play it early but as far as I can see its a bad copy of mixed fps games
592,Anonymous,11-Jun-20,8,Good FPS game and i really like the cartoon graphics i think you will like this game if you like cs:go too
594,Anonymous,11-Jun-20,0,1.Maps Are Broken2.Guns dont have aim sistem much. its chance little bit3. some characters are soo OP or not have enough power much for this game4. graphics are bad5. mechanics are trash6. Hacks are everywhere anticheat is a **** **** riot

601,Anonymous,10-Jun-20,0,boring agents. bad motion and graphics. similar other games. non original game. and vanguard.
604,Anonymous,10-Jun-20,5,"This game is like eating a piece of white bread its ok, decent, pretty good, but has no excitement its about as dull as you can get with a shooter."

614,Anonymous,10-Jun-20,10,"Much of these notes are clearly hateful to Overwatch and CSGO players who are feeling threatened by the potential of this game.It is a new game and will still go through many adjustments, but it is already an excellent game.Let them take care!"
618,Anonymous,10-Jun-20,10,Very fun I love the game its great for esporst it does not use up a lot of space and it has very low requments
619,Anonymous,10-Jun-20,0,"I didnt liked the game, I prefer counter-strike, more competitive and intense."
620,Anonymous,10-Jun-20,10,"Valorant is the most addicting game I've played in years with silky smooth gameplay, cooperation and is fun with friends. Riot had done an amazing job at trying to compete with csgo."
622,Anonymous,10-Jun-20,10,"Very addictive for someone who has never played a tact shooter, giving it a high score do to being a quality game that's free to play, if this was a paid title I'd pro ably give ut more around an 8 but I feel like this is appropriate giving the price"
625,Anonymous,10-Jun-20,8,I have played csgo for 5 years and this game feels very refreshing compared to it. The game is not for everyone but i still recommend it for anyone who likes competitive fps games.
628,Anonymous,10-Jun-20,0,"cheap chinese cs go copy, literally everything copyed from other games and CS GO, from movement to gunplay and they added bad part in game"

638,Anonymous,09-Jun-20,0,"I downloaded it quickly as soon as it was available, I played it and that's how fast I uninstalled it. It's a disgusting jumble between overwatch and the cs: go and not to mention the tech section, the physics, the gameplay ... It's literally one of those cheap Chinese copies, of course it is. I'll stay with OW or CSGO, sorry Riot. And if it is up to me to play one of your games, LoL."
640,Anonymous,09-Jun-20,10,"I think this game is similar to Csgo but i i think its better than it, i feel so much fun when playing this game a lot more than csgo"
641,Anonymous,09-Jun-20,9,"Can't understand the bad reviews! The first shooter who goes straight against hackers and the Riot Vanguard is a good thing for me to ensure that there is no chance for them! If you don't like it - just don't play it! I hope there will be more levels in the next time and some more guns to choose from. Its free, so give it a try and find out."
642,Anonymous,09-Jun-20,1,"Anti cheat is capable of making your computer have several problems. And when you enter the game, you notice a lot of hackers. It's ridiculous! They created a mix of CS and Overwatch, with CS not having the boredom Valorant has."

655,Anonymous,09-Jun-20,3,"When the announcement of this game was announced, the creators of the character will not have much impact in the game. Unfortunately, play this game from the beginning of her Beta, not once died only from the skills of the character, e.g. BreachThe game is very cool but skills need to be changed"
658,Anonymous,09-Jun-20,4,"A good game, yet it has the **** matchmaking I have ever seen. I have never EVER been in a game where I didn't win by a HUGE margin or lose by a HUGE margin. This is easily the worst matchmaking I have ever seen and it has sucked out ALL the fun in this game."
660,Anonymous,09-Jun-20,0,Played about 20 games. I don't understand the hype surrounding this game.. This is a combination of tf2/csgo with a poorly executed design. Unfortunate. Don't download this game.
661,Anonymous,09-Jun-20,0,"Suck, copycat game Counter Stike and Overwatch.After Riotgames war with Moonton, and now, Riotgames follow Moonton about New Copycat Games.Original game (Counter Strike and Overwatch) still the best!"
663,Anonymous,09-Jun-20,8,"This is a Nice FPS Competitive game, it adds new aspects to the cs:go format of play. The abilities from the characters are game changing and are very fun to use. The weapons are different but works the same way of the classic ones, it's totally playable"

677,Anonymous,08-Jun-20,4,Its just CSGO but much much much much much much much much much much much worse.
679,Anonymous,08-Jun-20,1,"I seriously dislike how this game was built: from optimization and net code to how it's being marketed, as well as how invasive its anti-cheat is. FPS dips well below 30 FPS on my hardware, I'm experiencing constant connection issues and the worst of it all is just how I can't redeem my battle pass rewards. So thanks, Riot Games, but no thanks. I'm not touching it ever again."
682,Anonymous,08-Jun-20,0,"Its slowing down your PC. Very slow gameplay, not stable servers. It will not kill CS:GO believe me."
683,Anonymous,08-Jun-20,5,"The game feels empty. The maps are mediocre, weapons are not balanced. Overall, it is a slow and boring game."
684,Anonymous,08-Jun-20,5,"I have only had probably 10 hours of experience in this game, but over hundreds in csgo. Valorant feels like a mismatch of csgo and overwatch. The anti cheat definitely puts me off though."
685,Anonymous,08-Jun-20,0,"Juego aburrido, la peor copia de csgo y overwatch,  es como si sacaran lo peor de cada uno y lo juntaran. Totalmente aburrido de ver y jugar, no lo recomiendo."

689,Anonymous,08-Jun-20,0,"It's boring, no speed, no momentum, just walking. The maps are just rectangles"
690,Anonymous,08-Jun-20,8,I don't understand the hate. This game isn't perfect but it's a good game.It's not cs:go. It's not Overwatch.Some issues but overall I like it and that's from someone that hates Riot.
691,Anonymous,08-Jun-20,1,"No momentum. No violence. Snoozfest. And while snoozing, Tencent collects your data via the backdoor malware rootkit called ""anti-cheat"" Vanguard. :) Good times this 2020 is."
692,Anonymous,08-Jun-20,3,This game feels unfinished and lacks variety.  It's like someone reskinned CS-GO and threw in some random power ups that don't really fit.   I played a few rounds a day for a few days during the beta and uninstalled and have had no desire to go back to play it again.
693,Anonymous,08-Jun-20,1,It's like Counter Strike but in boring. Why would somebody play something like this?
694,Anonymous,08-Jun-20,0,Over a week since release still not received paid for battlepass rewards or free hero unlocks. Random recoil patterns. Just a bad attempt at csgo
695,Anonymous,08-Jun-20,0,Just a cheap mimic to counter-strike. Not even as good as cs1.6. Stupid on all fronts.
696,Anonymous,08-Jun-20,0,"Just another FPS game made only to win money. The game is just a boring copy of CS:GO and Paladins where kids play rankeds beliving they are ""pro gamers"". Won't play the game until there is a gamemode that doesn't feel like a waste of time."
697,Anonymous,08-Jun-20,5,"Some say it's a mix of overwatch with cs go, but honestly there's no way to compare, the game is fun to a certain extent but doesn't deliver anything new to the fps market, but the most important thing is that it's not good to shoot with the weapons just like in other popular games, just don't convince."
698,Anonymous,08-Jun-20,10,there's no worse than fan-boy. No:for me the game is good with flaws but will get better over time.the opinions against these games are really ridiculous you feel the frustration of the cs:go players.
699,Anonymous,08-Jun-20,10,"People are so dumb that they dont understand that the character has to be slower than cs:go simply because the maps are smaller. + the game has no cheaters, different from cs:go, 128 ticks servers, nice shot reg."
700,Anonymous,08-Jun-20,2,"Where's the violence, speed and momentum??? This game is a snooze fest! This is what is being hyped? Wtf happened to the game industry?"
705,Anonymous,08-Jun-20,0,game is basically a csgo nnoverwatch copy and complete scam anticheta with **** gameplay.
706,Anonymous,08-Jun-20,10,A revitalizing take on the CS formula. I had a lot of fun playing this for the past few days. So easy to jump into. Really loving this game and I look forward to playing it in the future.
707,Anonymous,08-Jun-20,10,It's a nice game with good gameplay.It has many champions and nice weapon skins.
710,Anonymous,08-Jun-20,2,"1/3 overwatch, 1/3 counterstrike, and 1/3 nothing because the game feels empty and soulless. Filled with gimmicks and less than the sum of it's parts. Riot should stick to MOBAs."
712,Anonymous,07-Jun-20,10,I'd say the game is more an 8-9 but I'll put 10 because so many people put 0 when they didn't even play the game.
715,Anonymous,07-Jun-20,1,"This game is god awful. Shots do not register, and they all feel the same, besides if you are using a shotgun or a sniper. Recoil on guns are not balanced at all. There is a certain smoothness that is missing. I really wanted to like this game but maybe after time it will actually be worthwhile."
722,Anonymous,07-Jun-20,10,"Half of these people who are complaining havent even played this game, lag is beacuse you have worse internet or computer & gunplay in my opinion is good in this game, just learn to aim or something if you have problems. You can just change your crosshair & dpi.Hate comes from some csgo players & a lot from fortnite players too. I mean fortnite players hate everything."
723,Anonymous,07-Jun-20,4,"The game does not feel up to par to other fps out there. It is clunky, slow, the aim must be improved and the fact that your character gets slowed when hit makes it harder to walk side to side and try to deflect.The skills are a nice add but if they're not granades, they're not important.There are better fps out there, Valorant has gotta improve to compete with those."
724,Anonymous,07-Jun-20,8,"This could be a 9 if the ban system was better. for example when they kicked me and everyone because just a teammate was cheating, Not everyone just him,My second complainant Are the graphics, as of 2020 this looks pretty meh, but the fps count are pretty good so this one is passable, the rest of the game is good"
726,Anonymous,07-Jun-20,4,"A very slow, very shallow game. Fundamentally works fine, but far from the 9.0 ""game critics"" want to merit this game for."
729,Anonymous,07-Jun-20,8,Great game have some problems but as a new game and still in beta version it's okay for the main complain that valorant is a cs.go clone well it's not the two games have a similar style yes but cs.go Don't own the that style of games i'm saying this as a cs.go player  and riot games have done a great job.
732,Anonymous,07-Jun-20,0,"What a disaster! Mobile graphics, bad mechanics, poor sound system, horrible anti-cheat system. These clowns though they can keep the audience if they do stupid random drops on twitch. The truth is this game is nothing except a rushed copycat of so many other games."
733,Anonymous,07-Jun-20,10,Valorant has kept me entertained for hours with no signs of slowing down. Love additions made post launch.
734,Anonymous,07-Jun-20,1,Revealing abilities suck hard. How to play an fps if enemies know your position?
737,Anonymous,07-Jun-20,8,"the graphic it ok because of that my pc can handle the game but there still some lag,the game play it kinda similar to csgo and some of the shoting game but there is some problem the hitbox it kinda annoying and when the game start you had to play to the end"
746,Anonymous,07-Jun-20,3,"It is basically overwatch and CS: GO but of a disastrous quality, I have had to disagree because my friends download any **** thinking it is something new. Despite the fact that it's clearly recycled content, anyway, a forgettable game that is nothing more than a retro clone to trick rat children and take money from their parents in crappy macro transactions. 3/10."
749,Anonymous,07-Jun-20,0,"As a game that is trying to compete against the likes of CS:GO, Valorant takes the worst parts of Rainbow Six Siege (traps that interfere with your aim) and ""innovate"" by implementing maps with 3 bomb sites. It is funny that this competitive skill-based shooter has weapon spread that is similar to Fortnite."
750,Anonymous,07-Jun-20,1,"Stale, with no fresh take on the tac shooter genre.Agents tend to lean towards toxic and aggravating playstyles in the game (stall.. stall.. and more stall..)"
752,Anonymous,07-Jun-20,1,"The shoot mechanic ingame is so dumb! The first bullet will miss 100% when you aim your enemy head. The agent's skill is some useless, some too overpower. I like the game's idea but this not the game I want"
755,Anonymous,07-Jun-20,1,"Nominee for one of the worst hype-balloon games of all time, it steals from CS: GO and Overwatch yet fails miserably on both sides. Game feels very unfinished and clanky."
757,Anonymous,07-Jun-20,10,All-around great game that makes you want to keep coming back for more. Really fun
760,Anonymous,07-Jun-20,10,"Great game, a lot easier to get into compared to CS:GO but it still has the same high intensity and quick gun fights. The abilities are a lot more fun than standard equipment in other tactical shooters."
761,Anonymous,07-Jun-20,0,"My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is completely ruined. This game is so bad that I have no words for it, The anticheat is also trash I'm gonna cry"
763,Anonymous,07-Jun-20,10,This best FPS game I ever played. It just have 3.5 gb. THX DEVELOPERS :) :) :)
764,Anonymous,07-Jun-20,9,Beautifully designed and optimised. Very Smooth and fun gameplay. Nothing incredibly original.
767,Anonymous,07-Jun-20,2,I play CS:GO and Overwatch and here's my review:-Game feels slow and gets boring fast.-You move like penguins.-Guns need to be adjusted.-Unbalanced operators.-Bad map designs that are made for campers.I hope Riot improves the game.

774,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,0,"Graphics are nice, but the matchmaking is atrocious and the tutorial doesn't even come close to explaining how to play the characters."
775,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,10,"The game is amazing, it brings me back to the good ol' CS1.6 Days. Guns are snappy, characters are easy to see and the community has been great so far. Don't believe in the fake negative reviews. CSGO and Overwatch players are worried because the new kid on the block is about to steal their thunder."
776,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,10,the game is very good. The CS GO players only cry because they can't cheat so well here
779,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,10,"Love this game from the first sight, super entertainment and diverse play style,"
788,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,10,"Playable on every computer, no bugs, no problems, very nice gameplay, Its free to play, we had lots of fun with this game so far."
790,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,0,"Riot, stop buying ads, no one never asked for this. The game looks like it was made by 5 students on the Unity engine. (like Unturned) Nuff said."
793,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,1,"Valorant is very unoriginal. This game feels like it is missing something big to make this game its own. Overall, Valorant feels like a combination of CS:GO and Overwatch, whilst also being a worse version of both. It also has clunky gunplay, and slow gameplay. Valorant feels like a game that was designed to go viral and do well on twitch, rather than being designed to be a good game."
794,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,2,Screw games and devs who open up games to streamers months before release. Instant fail for me.
796,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,7,"It's a good team objective shooter not anything new in the world of shooters, it play's like CS:GO with an overwatch feel, not for everyone but my time on it has been enjoyable but when it comes to connect errors it can be a bit"
798,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,2,Mediocre game with an even worse anti cheat that not only makes your pc prone to attacks but slows your pc down
801,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,10,Review bombing in games is the stupidiest thing people can do. Reviews are meant to help people decide if they should give the game a try. So bombing is just stupid and forgets the whole point of reviews. I'm not saying it is wrong to post a negative review on a game. I'm saying that if you are gonna do it. At least do it right.
802,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,10,"I'm a CS GO player and I've been playing Valorant for the last few days and I really like it. Even though the game has a lot of problem's, I believe that they will be fixed."

807,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,10,"This game is amazing , everyone shoud be try it.Do not let the negative reviews of people who have not really experienced such a review game."
808,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,2,To many corners in map design. To many oneshots for such slow game. Confusing abilitys. Boring design.But at least it is free.
810,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,10,I don't even know why they hate this game 
815,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,9,"i think this game is a new experience. I have played CSGO for a year and this game is different from CSGO. Graphic is not the best of this game. Is normal but the gameplay i think is good. If you find a game to relax or try hard, come to Valorant"
817,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,10,"Why 5.7 user score? this game is amazing!the perfection , Counter-Strike Global Offensive with OverwatchFirst Person Shooter with SkillsI love this game , please, change your score with this gameVery nice Riot Games, nice work with thisI'm mono sova"
824,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,10,"it's very good, and need to improve a little graphics, Need to balance Agent,"
826,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,10,"hella fun game, memorable characters, graphics are stylish and aimed to work at low end PCs, most negative reviews are butthurt cs go and OW fans who are threatened by the game, grow up."
827,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,0,"graphic of 2011, half overwatch half CSG:O gameplay. Map design so stupid and bug too much"
830,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,5,"Servers feel better than CS:GO's Valve hosted 64 tick ones, all the weapons feel like their actually viable in one situation or another and the agents abilities don't feel like they overpower the actually mechanical skill of the players"
831,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,10,this is a very good game i dont know why toxic csgo players give 0/10 **** retards
833,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,2,Weird weapon mechanics and sounds. Anticheat s*cks - I've hacker in the first match. Playing this game is really discomfort for me.
834,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,2,"The game may be fun because it brought the good points of successful games. But this game has no originality, Vanguard, errors in character setting (the ninja character is Korean? huh), there are many problems like above. In a nutshell, ""it's a lazy game."""
837,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,10,"Great game! I love it to be honest. What i specificaly like is the agents in valorant, that's the best way and competitive gameplay. Worth a try!"
839,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,10,"The game strongly resembles csgo, but it is unique enough to be a different experience."
840,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,2,"Looks Budget, in my opinion Not a esports Game. Movement awful, very little weapon Selektion."
841,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,0,"All the hype is purely marketing money.The game looks too old for its time, it has a terrible ragdoll animation, the game environment looks so stale.  It reminds me of bad mobile games in terms of looks and feels."
842,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,10,This game so good. But the bad thing is that some people don'tjudge it objectively and despise it
843,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,10,"Great game! I love it to be honest. What i specificaly like is the agents in valorant, that's the best way and competitive gameplay. Most fun with 4 friends. Worth a try!"
844,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,4,"The gameplay is okay at best.The map selection is poor (it's just released, I know) and some maps are just completely one sided.Major downside, kernel level anti cheat system, I hope this catches and people see it as a bad thing at last."
845,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,0,"The best crashes simulator 2020, not playable at all. They say that you can play Valorant even on a calculator, but it feels like they made it only for calculator, because my pc can`t stand this peace of garbage."
846,Anonymous,06-Jun-20,10,"It's a great game, really fun to play, easily recommendable. Good map design and game play. it isn't as easy as it looks, quite challenging. Loving it so far"
854,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,9,"Great gunplay and fun abilities, a bit of a skill floor but overall great experience."
856,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,Best fps game to be launched in 2020....fun to play. I was bored playing csgo and needed to play something more versatile and cheater less game.
859,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,"Better than OverwatchBetter than CSGOIf you hate Valorant, go away stupid hoe"
863,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,0,I mean you can't just stick one game with another game and then get a high score.
864,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,0,Very boring and uninspired game with awful graphics. Gunplay isn't fun either and the game was just overhyped.
867,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,1,"Valorant is a shameless plagiarism of other franchises.But, without any attractive or any other feature that makes the player want to play.The marketing team made this ""little cat"" look like a ""lion"".When it launched, inevitable disappointment..."
868,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,super successful launch and beta. very good game.has a low score due to intentional review bombing from csgo players feeling threatened that their game  has competition. absolute cringe kids
872,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,0,Such trash game I don't know what makes me more mad the fake people that try to say this game is good or the toxic environment in the game where they talked **** to my friend for not being good.
875,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,0,"I couldn't even log into the game due to a general ""Conection Error"". You can disregard my review because of this, but this is also because RIOT GAMES just COPY everything"
876,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,It's a very good game with a very interesting idea. This game is truly exciting and you want to play it again and again.
878,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,1,"It feels like a very Cheap version of CS:GO and Paladins, the most weapons are very clunky or CS:GO weapons with other names. This game feels very, very, very, very slow and the Spraypattern is disgusting. Riot comon i knew you can do better stuff but please fix first the lol clint befor you try to make a shooter. :("
879,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,2,"This is a really unpolished incomplete game. At first it was fun, but I quickly ran out of things that were fun. The devs are money hungry, the UI sucks, the rewards suck, and gunplay feels unpoilshed. This game is so bad it hurts to play now."
882,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,"Amazing game, the gameplay is very addicting and makes me strive to be better."
883,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,Game feels insanely smooth to play. Character designs are interesting and the abilities really bring something new to the tact shooter genre. Can't wait to see this game go far for the next decade!
884,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,0,"Game is broken. This is not a release, more like an alpha version. **** servers, low ping but constant packet loss"
885,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,9,This isn't the game that might be on the first look. There are a lot more mechanics from other competitive games. Even from MOBAs. After about 10 hours you start to understand that this is not just an abomination of CSGO+Owerwatch. Give it a try as it's truly worth it.
886,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,"I'm a casual gamer. Have never played shooters, especially 5v5's one. But when i started playing it, I actually had fun and still having it. Even despite matchmaking issues (cause being killed by CS:GO players is kinda sad, but I can understand, that it's hard to compare people's skill on launch, so no hate here). Graphics seems stylish for me. I guess, you should give it a try."
887,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,9,"A lot of fun, no hate or something like in cs go. I believe they will fix all problems in short term and will give us a lot of new content"
889,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,8,"Great game with alot of potential, I'm excited to see what is Riot's roadmap. Even if its a copycat of multiple games, it managed bring freshness to the hardcore shooter genre like csgo. Although, the community seems to be really toxic but it's an inevitable issue to every competitive shooter."
890,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,9,"Good game, I'm having a great time with it. This is just the beginning, I wonder how it will develop."
896,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,3,"With an intrusive anti cheater. This game made my Windows OS break and I had to reinstall it. Besides that, the game is so unstable with ping, giving me sometimes a ping over 300. Graphically it's okay, but, still looks like a copy from other games. The gameplay is repetitive and boring sometimes with so many gameplays points copied from another famous game as Overwatch and CS GO."
899,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,1,I don't like the comic graphic and the concept of different characters with different powers. Also u don't get any feedback if you get hit
902,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,The best FPS I have ever played. I think PPL that are crying here cuz the dnt know how a good FPS should look like. It is a bit buggy but devs are doing great job fixing them as soon as it is possible and it just started so I think it is normal. And they are listening to advices not like some other FPS devs do.
904,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,"objectively, the game is technically much better than cs go.banal, here it is better to register hits.what spoils the experience of the game is the community, but what you wanted from a game that runs on any PC."
905,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,"Fun, demanding and refreshing although largely based on CS. The differents agents give the game a really good feeling."
906,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,8,"Good game, five percent negative ratings from my mother's critics. I withdraw 2 points for the lack of voice chat in Russia:)"
908,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,0,"This needed more time in the oven.  Also, I don't want foreign software in my kernel.In these types of games, damage is a bad way to go for abilities. This changes the game into a spam fest and less of a shooter game. The focus needs to be shooting, not overpowered damage abilities. Look at Apex legends, none of those abilities are direct damage."
910,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,9,"Valorant is an interesting blend of two major titles, being Overwatch and CS:GO. It takes the gun play and precise movements from CS:GO and utilizes abilities similar to Overwatch, while not being overwhelming like the latter can be. This blend offers to more exciting and diverse game play and requires more strategy as every situation will be different."
912,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,4,"Boring weapons, boring heros, boring maps, boring leveling up system, and definitely a boring game."
914,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,1,"Fix your **** servers, packet-loss everywhere, everytime we play we lag for no goddamn reason."
916,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,9,Is a solid game and I have been having fun trying to come up with strategies that might become the new meta
919,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,0,"Very generic and boring multiplayer shooter. It wants to be both CSGO and Overwatch, but it's not fun to play more than a couple of matches, nor is it interesting to watch on stream."
920,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,9,It makes very much fun the only point that matters is that you can't leave lobbys when you have bad team mates. But away from that I think this is on of the best free and paid games.
923,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,4,I  don't know why but i was expecting more maybe is because the game is new but it doesn't have much originality
928,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,"Great game, for now, feel like something new, interesting gameplay and good optimization."
930,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,9,"This game is very good, i'm really enjoyed it. BUT Riot Games's balance team still SUCK!!!"
931,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,"Fantastic game, love the art style of the abilities, the game can run on almost any computer, but most importantly, its not garbage csgo."
933,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,3,"0 for mechanics and gameplay. It's just take forever for 1 game, and it's just boring.3 for being truly free to play."
936,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,0,"Bad graphics, bad shooting, bad economy, bad skins, everything is bad in this game!"
937,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,2,"After 4hours, Uninstalled, the gameplay feels like an 2000s game with graphics of 2015,  sound design is terrible, it feels slow, gunplay is basic, it can be a bit fun with friends, but they're better and funnier games that we are playing currently."
939,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,Valorant is one of the best First Person Shooters on the market. It's clear that a lot of the reviewers here are Call of Duty or Overwatch players...I feel sorry for the employee who has to read through these trash reviews.
941,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,"CS players were afraid of an ambitious competitor, and decided to minus the gameI wish VALORANT a lot of cool and high-quality content that will make this game better. And of course I wish you not to be the boring, gray game that Valve has already abandonedHow's your Souce 2, huh?)"
942,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,"Valorant is a fun take on csgo and over watch, is it perfect no. No game is perfect however I have yet to find a game that I love more!"
943,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,"I don't even play valorant but i hate review bombings so im giving a 10, because in reality for what i saw and what my friends tell me, its a really nice game, not a ripoff of CSGO, it has new fun mechanics. the only problem is the balancing, but the game has 3 days, just give it time."
944,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,9,"Even tough it has been officially launched in the past few days, the game seems to still be in development. Despite of that, this game is fun and the mechanics are pretty good."
946,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,0,Game feels very empty and bland. It's getting praise for it's art style and graphics and I can't fathom why; It looks like slightly more polished ps2 graphics.All of that aside you SHOULD NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME as it literally comes with malware. Research before installing at least!
947,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,0,"This is a bad kid of OverWatch and Cs:Go.Graphic is bad, but light work is good."
948,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,"Whoever said that, but I liked the game. I play with CBT, I survived a bunch of bugs. Nevertheless, I believe that the game has good prospects because of the correct approach of the developers. Well, you can compare games endlessly, and this is the most useless activity in the world. Like - play, do not like, do not play. That's all)"
951,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,Not shooter fan but love this game! Nice visual style and great optimisation.
953,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,9,"Great game, doesn't look to great but this gives it more clear graphics which I think is more important. Love it!"
956,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,"As said by a lot of players and professionals, the game is definitely not ready to be released yet but, nonetheless the game is still great fun and combines two great video game genres, a Tactile FPS and a Hero shooter.Would recommend to anyone who doesn't think it's a straight up clone of CS:GO."
957,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,I love the game's graphic a lot. The gunplay is also great and the abities make it on of the best games I have played
961,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,8,"Great game, definitely a big CS:GO rival. The only issues are : weird matchmaking, a lot of AFK's and no option for bot player like in CS and no rankeds so far and a lot of trolls due to that. Otherwise game is great, did everything CS:GO should have done few years ago and I hope they will keep working on the game to beat CS:GO in the final :)"
962,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,9,I played beta and LOVE this game. Its a mix between overwatch and counter strike.
963,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,0,"Valorant is just some **** that got boosted like ""WOAH OH SUPER ULTRA GAME"" but actually it ended up being total crap."
966,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,0,"CS with waifus. Maybe try to make an original game for once. Also, anyone who thinks this game is even 1% similar to OW is a moron."
968,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,0,Took 9 months to get full release.Release game not in your region Timeout Gooseman country is very disappointed
971,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,4,"The anti cheat should be removed. I don't want a root kit in my pc just to play valorant. And, it can still be bypassed"
972,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,0,Worst game I've ever played. An abundance of cheats and cardboard graphics that strain the eyes and not only.
974,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,0,"Unplayable. Error code on launch every time. Clearly unfinished and shouldn't have been released as a ""complete game"""
975,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,Such a fun and loveable game and riot games does deserve love and support for this game.
978,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,9,"I've been playing csgo for more than half of my life, fps games is my only lifeAnd this game, is something rlly new from what I've seen before , dont trust csgo mainers they just trying to bring the game down with there negative reviews, just give it a shot, you will like it)"
980,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,1,"It's a good game if you are bored and want to become even more bored. Terrible everything. The gunplay is one of the worst ive experienced, maps are really boring and repetitive. Pacing of the game is horrible. The cartoony design makes me want to puke. Don't play this game."
981,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,"Some people think this game is just a rip off of csgo. I think that is completely untrue, and is just something for people who want a more ability based game. I think the skins are great, for a reasonable price, and the game is free to start off, as well as having unique graphics, and great gunplay. 10/10"
983,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,2,"Riot games dosent undestand what balance is in an competitive game they cant even balance leauge of legends for almost a decade in an fps games need blance you cant put a ""scout rifle"" in a game where there is healing  its never gonna fix a money dump for the company they swim to far to quick"
985,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,"Good game, interesting skills, very beautiful drawing. a promising project, I hope it will be developed and not abandoned"
986,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,feels great the gun play is awesome. This fps is very unique with its abilities and the map design the fact you use your abilities as utilities and not as something to kill in my opinion improves skill cap you need to think more than other fps games.
989,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,6,"The game is pretty OK. Really love the art style and the heroes' personalities. However, Vanguard is a HUGE pain in the ass. I've restarted my PC these past weeks (due to issues with Vanguard) more times than I've restarted it last year :/"
991,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,0,"This game doesn't do anything innovative or fun, it's all taken from other hero shooters, in my experience it doesn't bring anything new to the table and it isn't even the best at what it does.The anticheat is invasive and people can already bypass it, the developers posted a few posts on it literally calling themselves god of some sort for designing it but it greatly exposes the user."
993,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,"One of, if not the best shooters on the market. It combines CS:GO with R6 with a OW artstyle and it is a lot of fun! Amazing!"
995,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,10,"This game is smooth, dynamic and super fun. Is it perfect? For me (a casual player) yes, for others maybe not..."
997,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,0,"Very raw game, MM is broken, graphics is still back 1987, does not worth your time."
999,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,8,"Nothing too innovative, but Valorant's a pretty solid and refined tactical shooter. As a fan of CS, this game is a nice breath of fresh air with the agent abilities. Only problems with the game are general map design, and RNG shooting after the first few shots. Other than that: pretty good game!"
1002,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,I wanted to try the game and I lost my PC because of Valorant. My HDD is dead.
1006,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,Quite possible one of the worst FPS games I've ever played. You know how chinese companies made like 25 versions of Autochess in a month? This feels like one of those games. A s****y chinese rip off with very bad design elements.
1012,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,5,"Without a choice of maps, the game is unplayable. I'm tired of playing only on Ascent"
1013,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,dude how can you even spam negative things about this game it has just launched and is absolutely incredible. It has good mechanics and after all even a potato pc can run this
1014,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,8,"A lot of fun to play, especially with friends. Gunplay feels tight and responsive, and the abilities give an added layer of skill to the game. The only things going against it are its lack of game modes and progression at launch, but with ranked releasing sometime soon I'm excited for the future of the game. Hopefully the esports scene for this game grows as well!"
1015,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,4,"I always play a FPS game when i have some time ... But with valorant, i played for 3 days and i have no more enjoyment with it. CS:GO can give much more fun, R6 or Overwatch can make the operators system such better ... Valorant don't got mt hearth"
1017,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,2,The game is bad and this is my objective opinion. It look like CS and Overwatch but bad in its core. After playing the game you think that you'd better play Overwatch or CS instead Valorant.
1023,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,6,"Eh. It copies csgo's economy and also has the same gun play as csgo with the addition of ADS. Some of the abilities feel clunky and annoying to use and there are only two maps but the game is still fun to play and is unique enough that I wouldn't call it a clone. More so ""heavily inspired"". My biggest issue is the anti-cheat is extremely invasive and kinda annoys me."
1025,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,"Terrible game. Not going to play a game with rootkit malware installed, especially when the game company is fully owned by a Chinese surveillance mastermind, Tencent. On top of that, graphics are pretty trash, not realistic fps shooting when compare to csgo. Its like the weird hybrid that people try to put everything together but failed at pleasant anyone."
1026,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,"Best multiplayer game i've played in a while. I really don't like the anti hack system. It feels a bit invasive and I really hope they fix that, among few little things. The game is good as hell. CSGO players are just mad."
1030,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,It's just boring. It isn't really giving me fresh new fun game vibes. The gameplay is very clunky. It also doesn't strike me as a casual game. It's literally all twitch hype.
1031,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,"Below average f2p CS clone that does not understand what makes CS work.Movement and gunplay are on par with any generic chinese free to play shooter. Maps are absolutely terrible and completely miss the point what makes ""tactical shooter"" maps good."
1033,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,"Mind blown how terrible one game can be after a month of closed beta to work out the issues. Graphics are bad, gameplay and movement is awful for the type of game they wanted it to be. anti cheat system is just to make extra money off your personal data, connectivity issues alone make me want to uninstall. wouldn't recommend to anyone"
1036,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,8,"Although the game is not perfect, it's a free game that's fun to play with friends, it's main focus is teamwork, strategy, economy, and good old FPS shooting. I would recommend this game to anyone from a brand new player to an experienced vet!"
1037,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,5,"Good game. But I think the default weapon skins from this game are not very easy to identifiable for beginners.  All of them are the same color, I tried to shoot a guy, but I didn't know that it was an automatic fire mode. This will likely the most basic mistake of the beginner."
1040,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,The most fun I've had **** around and doing stupid strats. The abilities make the game play in a completely diferent  way from CS or OW. Loving it so far
1041,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,"Great game imo, only thing it lacks is originality and I think it's the main reason for all the negative views. Really hope this game continues to have a loyal player base and not get turned away by CSGO players that hate new games"
1043,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,"This is a very good game, it shoots great, abilities are cool, everything was done with a bang!"
1045,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,9,"Valorant is a polished tactical shooter that simplifies and streamlines CS:GO's mechanics with the personality and uniqueness of Overwatch's characters. The game is polished, smooth, the sound design is perfect and the guns are well balanced. the game has flaws like the anti-cheat and the training range but it's a really fun game if you are willing to learn it"
1048,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,"Really cool game, in my opinion much better than CS:GO in many aspects. I love it and would recommend it to anyone who looks for really competetive FPS. I also cannot say Its CSGO clone because it has too many diffrent things and the games do not feel the same at all."
1049,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,5,"Well, this game not really good and not too bad, it's free and its fill like free game"
1050,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,Valorant is the best game ive played so far. Its a great recreation of csgo which in itself was a great game also.
1054,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,2,"Not different enough from CS, graphics are terrible. I understand the emphasis on readability, but it just looks flat out cheap. Abilities are unbalanced as well."
1058,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,"I'll admit I was excited for this game after I saw it on stream for a bit. But playing it is just laggy, same and just not fun in a way that is hard to explain. I just don't want to play it."
1059,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,0 is an insult. I understand that there are actual problems in game but 0 is a little to much. There i a reason why pro's think valorant is the future of e-sports
1061,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,7,"If i could get my rewards, it would be cool. There is still so much bus to be fixed, I feel its still beta."
1063,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,"Poor map design, boring visuals, unimaginative gameplay and a lack of overall thrill you get with its rivals. Simply put Valorant is a game so ignorantly focuses on being competitive that it forgot to be fun..."
1065,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,"This game is excellent. There are very few faults to Valorant and it's definitely a strong 10. I was lucky enough to test it during beta and now playing the game live, it's still awesome. It has the competitiveness that a hardcore shooter needs, but it also allows for a lot more plays than just your regular running and gunning."
1066,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,"By far the worst and most unenjoyable games I've ever played. The characters have some features that are just flat out dumb for the game, making their ""competitive"" shooter completely unskilled. I advise everyone to not run the game as their anti-cheat is sketchy and there's many cheaters still. Avoid this game at all costs."
1067,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,Antiquated black F***** bars what is this the 1920's not 2020. Give UW monitors a proper resolution and not bungle them with the only other thing you don't condone which are cheats! Until then this game can go sit on the trash pile.
1069,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,Best game i played in a long time of course many thing to upgrade but theres a future in it.
1070,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,Some of the most fun I've had in a game in a long time. IMO the graphics/ gameplay are better than CSGO and I get the sense that people are sort of just bitter that CS has a competitor now. Some small improvements still needed but given that its the first week its great.
1074,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,First day out of beta is stronggood serversgood FPSFINALLY another tactical shooter other than CSGO
1076,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,"The game has taken what was good about CSGO, left out what was bad, and built on top of the good to create a refreshing new look at the tac-shooter genre.  It is an absolute pleasure to play.  I haven't been this excited for a game since Halo 2 way back in the day.  Keep up the great work, Riot Games!"
1079,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,This game is the most braindead game I have ever played in my entire life. Not only can you run and shoot there are also the most stupid abilities ever created. There is no sense of reward after hours of playing. Don't play this hot garbage trash when you can play overwatch or cod or cs go. The maps are also the most insanely stupid things I have ever seen in games
1080,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,Rito games' low quality don't know if this can be called a game thing. Censored for chinese.
1085,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,I played this game from Beta. I'm not a CS:GO fan but I play some games of CS and fell really hardcore. Valorant is different it easier. The game does have some issues and bugs. But the dev team always listen and satisfied  gamer need.
1086,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,Game is outdate af. It's look like conglomerate of other currently popular FPS titles.Pros:NoneCons:- whole idea and mechanics- maps- abilities- lack of personality- weapons- vanguard anti-cheat- horrible to watch
1087,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,"It's Amazing, Wonderful game, great communications with devs, big improvements"
1088,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,9,"Yes, Valorant has a few issues, but it is actually an amazing game. Most of the issues in my opinion is mainly because of how new it is. Most of the haters on here are mainly toxic and are trying to ruin this game. I say the best advice is to just download the game and try it yourself, since it is free."
1090,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,9,"I've been having a very good time with this game. It's quite challenging, but that makes it even more rewarding to do well."
1096,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,2,"Cheap, boring, looks bad. If it's CS:GO killer... well, only if devs from Valve will die cuz of laughting"
1100,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,The game is amazing. I have played a lot of shooters including CS & Overwatch. This is the best one out there for sure!
1101,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,"Wonderful game, great communications with devs, big improvements since beta."
1102,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,1,"Valorant is one of the most toxic communities in gaming, rng spray patterns, and a horrible anti-cheat application"
1104,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,Game is so good it's getting review bombed :)Such a fun and loveable game I had a blast when I played the game yesterday i love it
1105,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,I played the game in beta and now. They try do hard to make the game well and they are good at it. Please give it a try. 10/10
1109,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,3,"I have played CS:GO for a long time and i have some experience of playing shooters. I have played Valorant, and i felt there the mechanic of CS with another graphic. I think they did it to make it easier for players to switch to Valorant from CS. But i do not really understand the thing  with super abilities. There is some cheating abilities."
1113,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,RIOT CCCP games decided to not let you change aspect ratios in the game because **** you for buying a wide screen AMIRITE also their anti cheat is literally spyware
1121,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,"Stolen characters, mechanics and shooting (from CS and Overwatch) with bad optimization, extremely poor graphics and physics. I don't believe this game is going to have any success in the future. RIOT should spend their billions to programmers, not to paint LoL skins or buying ADs. Biggest game-dev failure in a long time."
1127,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,Good anti-cheat. Seriously. Very good anti-cheat. If you dont like playing with cheaters - play valorant.
1129,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,The game is trying to sit on 2 chairs.Wants to be Overwatch and CS: GO at the same time.But does not give any new experience
1133,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,"the graphics and the gameplay is dull. The game dont feel original, just a shadow of other fps"
1135,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,3,No serves. Bad connection. You want to take over cs-go spot please give us servers. Even Escape of Tolkov has servers in my country
1136,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,6,"Pros - The GUI, tutorial and training mode is nice.Con - This Game is really slow and boring,  The guns all seam the same.  The matches take forever to play.Very disappointed with all the hype coming in."
1137,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,"The reviews has bee harsh on this game and i dont see the reason. It is fun to play once you get used to the mechanics of the game, as its not as fast-paced as CoD or Apex. It is obviously inspired by CS:GO, but because of the different characters and their powers, it feels fresh."
1138,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,Clone of CS GO.Problems in my opinion:1. Recoil control2. Not all weapons will be destroyed with 1 bullet in the head3. Inability to balance different characters4. Customization for real money5. Very strong change in accuracy from slightest movements6. Wipe progress from a closed test is a crime7. Worst anticheat
1139,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,7,"This game is the new popular shooter, but it isn't ready for now: bugs, crashes, anti-cheat issues - that why i rated it 7 grade . But the rest - cool!"
1141,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,I like the art style and the smooth gameplay. The characters are pretty well designed The maps look clean. Just a solid game
1147,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,"I think the game is very good, just a few maps that need some changes, but that don't make the game bad, I came from lol and CS and I didn't think it was slow, unlike some who think the game is slow, will be very successful and especially in e-sports, I loved 10/10"
1151,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,Very crappy game. When im playing it feels like im playing those kind of CS knockoffs like crossfire and others.
1152,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,2,"Below average shooter, most of the game exists purely of copying other games, but only copying the bad aspects. poor graphics, balance feels off. anti cheat is scum. Offers absolutely nothing that isnt out there already."
1153,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,9,"Pretty fun game, great for improving your aim. The game in patch 1.0 has some minor bugs but nothing that affects gameplay that much.Gameplay: 9/10Art style: 8/10 Skins: 9.5/10Maps: 9/10 (new map is so good)"
1154,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,"I see bunch of CS:GO fanboys being hurted that their bad game is in shadow of this. Thanks for Valorant, Riot and Epic for killing Valve and their **** games like cs:go and dota, HAIL VALORANT"
1155,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,SOOOO SLOW csgo has more rounds and it feels 50x faster than this game. playing this game made me want to go back and play csgo
1157,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,"Very cool game, better than CS:GO that working more on skins.Valorant in that time working about anti cheat and community problems"
1158,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,3,"I really dislike the style of graphics. Although I have nothing against graphics, like in Fortnite or in Overwatch. Very inept work of designers as for me."
1159,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,2,"They not only made a CS clone, they made it look like fortnite with overwatch. It just doesn't make sense to me and seems like a poorly made ripoff."
1161,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,1,"Unoriginal gameplay, seriously outdated graphics, boring maps, copycat of csgo, gets boring quickly. This game would have been ignored by everyone had it not been developed by riot, who spent more on sponsoring their game than developing it."
1162,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,"Something as bad as this piece of game design comes out very, very rarely these days..."
1163,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,7,"The game is cool. 70% of the CSGO and 30% of the overwatch match perfectly. But sometimes it seems that the game is capable of more and as if a little more microtransactions than necessary. I do not like cartoon style, but here it is not felt. In general, I like the game."
1165,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,"Quick paced, good character mix, maps are each unique, awesome game to play with friends"
1167,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,"What is it trying to be? Its not a competitive shooter because a lot of rng and just unfair ""abilities"". It also plays much slower than overwatch and the gubplay feels wonky at times. I wqs so frustrated some times with the fact that you can never know where an enemy will come fom and retakes wre soooo bad. Thr map design is worthless."
1174,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,Basically counter-strike on a whole new levelFrom what I've seen gunfights are still extremely important but people are actually using their brains rather than 5 man rushing everywhere every round
1176,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,"Playing any game should be fun. But this piece of crap is not. Its just overrated, boring, slow and generic game that requires no skill."
1177,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,7,"Tactical gameplay, not the best maps, but good indeed. Haven't played it since the beta. But it could get better."
1178,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,1,"Played for a week during the beta then uninstalled. Tried to re-download after launch, but the anti-cheat has been causing my computer to blue screen constantly, and the game won't open. Not only doesn't the game not work, it also can break your PC. Hopefully a fix for this is released, because I'd love to try the game again."
1180,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,Easy version of CS:GO.Run softly in 8-years ago computer.Interesting Game
1181,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,"what is this? a paladins mixed with counter strike? poor copy of a CS im not going to play a poor game like this, maybe in future with some att I will try this game again..."
1183,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,This is just CSGO reskin plus characters from Overwatch (with bad design). This game is a waste of time and bad copycat.
1185,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,8,"I think this is a good game, of course it's just released and here not so many content, but gameplay is still interesting. Character desing is grate, maps is not bad, my only claim is Sova's ultra ability, cause it's almost always useless. I think we just need to give time for this game for making more content"
1186,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,1,Poorly built game that has tried to copy from other games but failed to hit what made them great.The graphics are very poor honestly for a 2020 game with frame rate issues. The game is also very clunky and feels like early alpha stages
1187,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,"valorant is clone of overwatch.overwatch is clone of tf2.cool.overwatch in some thinks was bad game.valorant cant be called as ""game"".its just boring clone of clone.nothink of new ideas.nothink of nice gameplaynothink of just normal storys.boring characters.and genius anti cheat...i cant find some good sides of this ""game""."
1188,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,1,Wow this game is just a poor cs clone. They wanted to make a game where it rips off a game and just splash a tiny bit of something different. Problem is the game is just poor. The game itself looks unfinished and just ugly and they just made this for twitch  hype. don't bother go play an actual good game
1194,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,8,"why do many people put 0? the game is not perfect, with its graphics it does not look nice, like an overwatch or fortnite. But the mechanics are excellent plastic shooting, but skill decides"
1195,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,"copypasted from dota, counter-strike and underlords. lord Gaben, sue them all!!!!!!!"
1198,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,9,"I played CS since 1.6, this is the closest thing to that 1.6 feeling I have ever played.Takes the good parts of CS:GO and builds upon them, cannot wait to see where this game goes."
1199,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,6,The game is very similar to one of the lots of license banned Chinese clones of a modern shooters. The graphics is awful. Gunplay is mediocre. Overall gameplay is boring. 6  - quite an honest  for the game.
1200,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,"It's very hard to score a game that force you to install backdoor on your pc. if you wan't to sell your data to Tencent (Owners of Riot), just send them it via meil. One point for system requirement."
1201,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,8,"Graphics are crisp, Networking and servers are low ping, Map design is consistent for competitive play but lacks variety for casual play.The game in its current state has the groundwork for a solid FPS shooter"
1204,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,Yo csgo frogs are mad big time haha Valorant > Cs. Don't forget to stay mad haters stay mad. I'm right
1205,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,9,"Great game overall. Very good communication with developers that listen to the community. Graphics are cartoony, but are very well done and the game runs on low spec computers."
1207,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,5,"Game just didn't grab me. I played about 2 dozen matches or so in beta, I thought there was going to be a massive update. I feel like some of the champs are must haves on your team, there is little map variety right now, and i'm not a fan of the ADS in this game. Overall I don't think there is anything inherently bad, games gets a solid meh from me."
1208,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,"Absolutely uncompleted game, but with copy-paste from other games and skins. Thank you, Riot Games"
1210,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,Great game that I thoroughly have been enjoying. It's free so shame on you for not trying it and wasting your time on this review.
1215,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,this game is really good!game made for people.this game i can run on wooden pc!antivirus dont make problem on my 3 pc's. Thats great!
1217,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,4,"ok , let be honest . this game itself actually bad and it was overrated . if you guys called me CSGO fanboy then everyone here gave it 10 is Riot fanboy. No way this game in the same boat with the last of us , red dead redemption . p/s : 10/10 my ass riot fanboy"
1221,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,"Enjoy paying 70$ for a skin pack, and then paying again to ""evolve"" those skins. If you like being ripped off and bending over for Vanguard to abuse your computer then this is your game."
1222,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,8,"To my surprise, a very fun game that most of the time feels smooth and engaging! Manages to bring something fresh even for people like me who didn't enjoy CS :) I love that the game runs well in older PCs.The launch had some problems and there is a certain feel of ""unfinished"" in it. However, I trust and expect this game to grow up to be better!"
1223,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,1,"It's like a ""csgo"" but graphics are ugly and boring.They didn't mix well..."
1224,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,"Those CS players make me wanna puke xD ""i didn't play this game but im gonna give it a 0 cause its new and similar to CS!!1! :( ""Freaking trolls. And cheaters. Freak them too."
1227,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,7,"A new perspective on shooter games. At the same time, there is a lot of FPS, matchmaking and server issues."
1229,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,2,This game is same with CS:GO and Overwatch. But if you're watching something like this and if you liked gameplay you can buy.
1230,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,2,"It's just lazy knock-off of Overwatch and CSGO but worse. Sound is lackluster, graphic is not from 2020, gameplay is just the worst. If it came from game company other than RIOT, this game wouldn't have been this popular. I'm guessing this game will die in about few months."
1231,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,"interesting but slow, boring yet somehow clunky, the guns feel janky, honestly, it could have been made better."
1237,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,0,Awful game the graphics are not upto par with the year 2020The anti cheat is as overhyped as the game and already been bypassed and cheats ran rampant for game alreadyThe game doesn't even know where they are headed with the gun mechanics i dont know if they want us to stop to shoot or just run and gun and it doesn't help that their anti cheat is basically a RAT
1241,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,4,The game looks like a mobile game that was put on pc. no decent animations and plays very much like a mobile game. such a shame to be honest. If you want a better version of this then just get counterstrike or overwatch
1242,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,Great game. Had fun playing. Seems better than other traditional shooter games and competitvely viable as well. Needs time to develop even further and am willing to wait for a great game to get even better. 10/10
1243,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,10,"Having so much fun with mates. U just need to practise your aim a little and understand how weapons, characters and spells works"
1245,Anonymous,04-Jun-20,9,Great game. Combination of CSGO mechanics with Overwatch-ish graphics.Whats even better? Gameplay still viewable unlike Overwatch which is a graphical mess
1254,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,9,"I really enjoy the game and the subtle details they put into it, for example, the parkour addition to the training map was unexpected but welcoming. Servers are stable and I haven't had issues in the 30+ games I've played so far. All and all I love it. Skins to overpriced  thou."
1255,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,I hope there is a special hell for cheap reskin developers like Riot Games. Please donate your resources to CD Project Red and delete your company.
1256,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"Ive noticed a bunch of negative reviews stating they have double posted their reviews. so dont beleive the negative hype.great game, diverse character set, maps are intricate yet simple. seems like a game with HUGE potential"
1261,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,This game will be fun if you play with your friends. Though people still really toxic like league but I hope this new game can live for over 10 years like lol and its will be a new eSport game
1262,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,2,"The games unplayable because of connection errors received mid game. I can barely play for 5 minutes without popping up. It's annoying, I wonder why it was release with so many bugs. I've gotten many errors and have tried all the fixes for it even the ones recommend from valorants support page. I've submitted a ticket but no response. This game isn't reccomended"
1263,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,Simply not a FUN game at all! It's like a bipolar game trying to be CSGO and Overwatch at the same time. It just doesn't work that way.
1264,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"The game's amazing , people should calm there asses down... As with every launch people need to fix stuff up , chill.. Riot is trying it's best to fix everything in launch... Just be patient for this CS GO killer"
1272,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"Really boring game, it doesn't add anything new to the genre just the same **** but worse and the anti cheat system goes pretty freaking far, so no to your  included spyware thanks, just avoid the game"
1273,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"The game knows what it wants to be. Pure competitive gameplay rewarding skill and practice. If you are looking for a well balanced, well maintained game with very skill reliant gameplay, this is for you."
1274,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"All these csgo  nerds hating on this game is funny. This is the most fun I've had playing a video game in years, and the game is only going to get better."
1276,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"The maps are extremely cluttered with hallways and corners, 25% of the map you don't even play on. The game plays extremely slow. The graphics look terrible, league of legends even looks better than how this game does. Skins are overpriced. The gameplay, in general, gets boring fast. This game doesn't provide anything new or better than what cs:go or overwatch already has."
1278,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,This is just Counter Strike Global Offensive's parody game. Curse from the beginning.
1279,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"I love riot, cs go and overwatch, but this game feels so hollow, it looks like an half-ass attempt to combine all famous element to make a money-producing machine instead of a great game."
1281,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"What an absolute joke of a game, it's a very average counter strike clone, but honestly what do you expect from riot, all they can do is copy valve games but make them worse apparently"
1285,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,7,"Got a lot of fps issues where it's difficult to play, but overall good game I think. 7/10 would reccomend but I hope they'll fix fps"
1286,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,A great combination of the best of CS and Overwatch. Lot's of fun and mostly good community. Also love the way Riot deal with cheaters.
1288,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"Game is world-class better than overwatch, the game takes care of the cheating issues and vanguard is goodriot community open to communicate with its fanbase others games would not do this which is why I know this game is going to succeed a lot"
1291,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"hit reg still terrible, fps still not up to csgo standards badly optimized (tabbing loses quite a bit for a few seconds)"
1294,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,9,A very fun game with balanced abilities and weapons. The game is extremely smooth and has great potential to be one of the biggest games
1297,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"Very fun game as a long-time Counter-Strike enthusiast. I like the pacing of this better and added utility of abilities. The game is very stream-lined and plays beautifully. Of course, there are some growing pains but you really can't beat this when it's offered up as free-to-play."
1298,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"Excellent competitive FPS game. If you're burnt out on CS, it's a breath of fresh air. Beware of cheaters whining about Vanguard disingenuously."
1300,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"I seriously do not suggest you install Valorant, as its installer contains Riot's own anti-cheat solution which by design is RING ZERO. It then waltzes right into your computer's boot sequence and says **** you, let me protect you""."
1307,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,7,"Its a fun game to play with friends and with a good competitive component, i really like the slower approach to this genre. I dislike the randomness of longer sprays and the bugs that still happen after full release"
1309,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"The graphics are ugly, I feel like I'm playing a game from the early 2000s. The game is so slow and not dynamic. In addition it is unbalanced. Lots of noise for not much. basiclly paladins with cs elements"
1311,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"Though it's true that this game had issues during launch, the gameplay is amazing, graphics are excellent, and the overall concept is amazing. I am truly captivated by what the developers have created and I look forward to playing this game for a long time to come."
1312,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"Would be an alright game... if it didnt have a rootkit that could be used to breach the security of its userbase. Seriously Riot we've seen this go bad before, just why?"
1313,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"A smooth, polished shooter with clean animations that can run on any potato with 60 FPS."
1314,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"As a player who comes from cs 1.6 and partially cs:go i can say that this game does not live to the expectations, really i downloaded the beta got hyped played 2 games and was begging it to end so i can alt f4 outta this. Game seems pretty good and all but this vanguard is really shady + it is really boring.tl;dr game is good but its boring as hell and probably spying on you."
1316,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,1,"its really bad this game,  thx riot games  : )))))))))))))))another trash game"
1318,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,1,Don't waste your time with this game. Doesn't work. The anti-cheat sodtware is garbage and the game has login crashes. Go play warzone instead.
1320,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"All of these mfs are giving this game zero stars for not being a carbon copy of Counterstrike or because it has abilities... like bro,take time out to learn how to play the game first before you write a review on it I known its frustrating to get **** on by all these experienced players but writing an angry review on Metacritic isn't gonna help you out."
1322,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"The gameplay is too slow, the hitreg is **** and the anticheat is the most intrusive one from a developer ever while it's basically doing nothing."
1323,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,Smooth very good videogame. If you like spells thats game for you. Its not like cs you wont get spin botted lmao
1324,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"Great game with unique, and good graphics, really fun and while being similar to csgo there is a distinct difference. The abilities and gunplay take some getting used to, but are very fun if you learn it. Each map has a theme behind it that makes for different gameplay. Give the game a try its free and com toe your own opinion on it.."
1327,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"It looks worse than fallout 76, a bunch of bugs / cheaters / imbalances in weapons and characters, the game looks like a game from a small studio and not from a worldwide studio, although I think for now the payers will pay the game will live."
1328,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,3,"Pros:The game will run on a potato and is free to playCons:The game looks like it was designed to run on a potatoThe movement is slowThe pacing is boringIt's free so try it if you like, but after a few hours it was just BORING to play so, seeee ya!"
1329,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,This game is incredible. Amazing gunplay with unique agents. The main reason people are leaving negative reviews is because Valorant is the final nail in the coffin for CSGO. Try it before you knock it.
1331,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,3,Not really fun. Only a few boring maps. Matches are a slog. Graphics are pretty bad. Games just drag along. Matchmaking is also pretty bad.
1335,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,I love this game so much! The gameplay is fun and new. The developers are really working in this game.
1339,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"I've been playing Valorant since closed beta start and i absolutely enjoyed it. Me and my friends have played almost every day and haven't met a single cheater of critical bug. I recommend it to you. It's free, so why not to try?"
1345,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,Great mix of cs and hero shooters. Balancing drasticly improving game day by day.
1346,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"Developers are incompetent.They focused on low ping and f*** up networking, made abusive anticheat which doesn't stop cheat and rushed to release a game full of bugs.If another company instead of Riot made this game such as Valve or Epic Games or even Blizzard this game would be better or atleast competitive playable."
1348,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,9,Great competetive shooter. Requires a lot of practice to master but easy enough to get an understaning of at a surface level if you are well versed similar fps games. Shooting is the core skill but the abilities helps you set it up and makes the game more varied and simply just more fun.
1349,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,I'm giving it a 10 since people in the reviews are being unreasonable.I already like it more than CS because I can queue on high mmr matchmaking and not catch a spinning bayblade that headshots me thru 3 walls.
1350,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"Absolute garbage, I am so disappointed in Riot Games. I hope the Fighting Game they are making won't turn out to be a failure like Valorant. Valorant is just not fun, you have to play it to understand what I mean. It is extremely boring, it mixed the worst aspects of CS:GO and Overwatch in an unholy abomination of boredom and no fun."
1351,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,2,"could be good, but isn't you got the problem of solo queue but amplified by a ton, you got skins worth an insane amount of money, you got an anti-cheat that is killing people's computes. The came could go somewhere but I don't think it will."
1352,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,2,"Counter strike with a mobile skin, slower and own by a shady Chinese company..."
1353,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,4,"I was genuinely very excited for this game. It felt like it had so much to offer and so much potential... now,after playing it after it was released I felt like the game was extremely boring and unoriginal. The maps are incredibly mundane and lacks any polish that CS:GO has. The 13 round matches are so tedious and bland... Sorry but I'm gonna pass on this game.  4/10"
1354,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,Great game !! Feels sad for valve and other haters.. their paid articles and rates are insane.. keep it up RIOT GAMES
1355,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,If you think this game is bad you are just bad. Get good and maybe youll enjoy yourselves losers.
1360,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,9,Cool game with lots of different heroes to suit your playstyle. Its fun mastering a agent and learning all the little tricks. Also playing with friends makes this a super strategic game!
1362,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,9,"Its Fun CSGO Frogs malding . but really they gotta fix the anticheat one of the downsides ,"
1363,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,3,"As long as CS Go exists there's no real reason to play this game, its a poor attempt at a copy with laggy and clunky movement and gun play and graphics that look like something out of a free to play mobile game. The map design is also extremely simple, they all use the same gray, brown and beige colors and if you've played one then you've played them all."
1364,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,8,It have some problems. I believe Riot will solve these problems. Could be better.
1365,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,They've made a wonderfully stylized and well balanced game. All the guns have a place and the characters are diverse and fun to play as.
1368,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"This is an extremely fun game with a high skill ceiling. Unfortunately it looks like its getting review bombed right now by salty csgo fanboys, and overwatch/cod players who arent used to a slower style of gameplay.That isn't to say the game is perfect, I normally woulnd't give it a 10/10 (probably a 7 or 8), but so many people are giving it zeroes i figured id try and balance it out a little."
1369,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"If this game was released when League of Legends did, it would be awesome. Now it's just like a flash explorer based game. Everything in this game is basic, animations, map, environment, damn even champions are just like a basic concept made by an indie company."
1373,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"Played for a while, it feels very weird, rather go for Counter-Strike or Overwatch."
1374,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"It's like CS:GO but more content to explain at all in main gameplay, more intensive, new character, new feelings, Recomended"
1375,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"This is unfair that some of you put 0. Guys, its a good FPS with its own pros and cons. But the speed how fast they managed to make game playable is impressive. All you CSGO and Overwatch fans now have a competitor who`s community will only grow!"
1378,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"Great game, cant even go back to previous games where it now feels something is missing. Will play Valorant for a long long time. Easy improvements would be a ranked system similair to league of legends."
1380,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"Nice game, classic shooter with abilities combined makes it one of the most enjoyable fps i have ever played."
1383,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"I like this game. After a lot of time with CSGO I got bored. Valorantis a breath of fresh air in the competitive shooters.Developers have great contact with community and despite theissues at the launch, the game is enjoyable.Developers are trying to patch known bugs.Style is very clear and you can easly see whatis happening on screen."
1386,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,6,"Valorant is a very calculated game. If you have no experience with FPS's then this game will be hard to get good in. If you put the time into it though you'll have an enjoyable time. Some cons I'd say is the gameplay always feels the same and there isn't much diversity. Also, the slow you get from taking fire is a very annoying mechanic. Standard shooter with not much difference to others."
1388,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,4,"I dunno, it was fun for the first 3 matches but after that... its really freaking slow and some of the skills are just op, and some just sucks really bad."
1389,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,Nothing new.Ugly graphics.Art style doesn't fit realism.Over agresive anti cheat system that runs allways doesn't uninstal with the game (such things should be illigal) doesn't stop cheaters.Doesn't run that well.
1391,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,3,"If you like to install malware on your PC, go ahead and buy Valorant. Hard pass."
1392,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,Super solid servers and FPS gunplay is top tier abilities are pretty balanced. Played over a hundred hours in beta and the changes they made to split plus the new map and mode are great. Definitely gonna be my new main game for a very long time
1394,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,1,"feels and plays like a Chinese rip off hehe.For a game with Riot as background. it really under preform.Game feels striped of life, like a Unity school project.the shooting is clunky and not really in good motion"
1397,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"Pretty good game. Have some things to improve, but I trust that Riot will fix it. Recommended 100% to old and new fps players."
1398,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"I am really enjoying Valorant. Not sure why so many are giving such a low score. I understand that some people might be turned off by this style of shooter, but that is not deserving of a zero rating. It's free so I would suggest you try it yourself and see if it's your style of game."
1399,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,Low score its from crying cs go players who dont know how to defuse/plant bomb
1401,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"Better than Counter Strike, just like how LoL is better than Dota, Valve fanboys mad :)"
1403,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,I am playing this game since beta release. Devs are in constant contact with players. Guns and maps are balanced. Some champions needs adjustments
1405,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"Great game, like overwatch, but f2p and faster paced, cool to play with friends."
1406,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"Great game, have been having a lot of fun. Greatly improved from beta. The devs listen and understand players. Can't wait for it to improve and be more"
1408,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"Combines everything I love from CS and Character based gameplay. Loved that they modeled the movement after 1.6, which is still the beat iteration of CS"
1411,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,It's a copy of CSGO and Overwatch lol and the gameplay is purely trash the characters look stupid and the graphics look like a game from 2010
1414,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"Playing since beta and I can't find anything more addictive! Game is realeasing and you can expect bugs, but the team on it is extremely efficient and listens to every community feedback I've seen"
1415,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"great game to play solo and friends :D good maps and characters 10/10, rly better than cs for me."
1416,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"this game just a copy, bad copy, valorant can't become legend,because it's copy from the start"
1419,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,I really like this game   i played  in beta and i will continue playing valorant long after
1423,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"This game has great potential and feels far better than other tactical shooters (CSGO, R6) to name a few.It's free - give it a try"
1424,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,Dont be fooled by the amount of zeroes on this page. Some are salty that people have an alternative to CS:GO. Others are salty  that they got banned by the anti-cheat. This game launched yesterday and will continue to get major updates as time goes on as Riot has been shown to support their games
1425,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"Genuine review.This game is awful. Just ctrl + c/ctrl + v from CS:GO, Overwatch and TF2. It brings nothing to shooter games sphere and not deserve all this attention at all. No more than a bad copy of truly good games."
1427,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,half counterstrike + half overwatch + a little bit  anticheat program which players make insane
1428,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,5,"For the first time trial it look well, has the power of ability but besides it has a slow mechanical  movement if compared with similar games like destiny/overwatch. Maybe movement mechanics can be little fasterI'm not talking about bug and any technical issue cause every game have both"
1430,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,1,"First of all, we have 2020 and the graphics look like at least a decade ago ... Secondly, I am not surprised by such a toxic community, a game from Riot, if you want to play alone, I advise you against, because you will be called from newbies and rookies to **** degenerates who doesn't even know what's going on..."
1431,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,The game is trash. Clone CS GO. Bad graphics and other people's ideas. There are better games
1434,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"overhyped twitch stream marketings, overcopied, overacting anti-cheats, and horrible graphics.Some might say the gameplay itself is okay but not for me mate. Would rather play csgo, overwatch, R6, pubg. A good example of how not to make a game."
1436,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,9,"Great start. Already added a new map and new character after Beta, takes a lot of the good elements of CSGO and adds some overwatch flare. Will be a large esport"
1437,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"These troll comments are ridiculous. It is a pretty enjoyable game. It has some annoying ingame things, but the game does not deserve this rating."
1438,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,The gameplay is so boring and repetitive and the game is completely single core bound pretty much the worst online game. To be fair I did play games that had some flaws but at least the characters where cool and attractive so it was worth playing but Valorant is filled with flaws and has the most boring and bland characters you can find in a game.
1442,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"The game is very slow, boring and bland. There is no emotion in the gameplay, the maps are very clostrophobic and with many strange angles. VALORANT is just another bland fps, I can't recommend the game"
1444,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,1,Not good because not available for Console and low quality ................
1455,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,3,"It's not original at all. I would rather play CS:GO if I want a ""tryhard"" tactical fps. Also, in my opinion, the price of their skins is outrageous. Another offender is their invasive Anti-Cheat, I really don't feel comfortable with that on my PC."
1457,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,2,"Its a soulless game filled with hackers, eventhough you have to install spyware to play it.A 2/10 the potential it could have in the future"
1460,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,4,"Overrated, repetitive and with no identity. Maps are so claustrophobic, Riot should release map creation tools to the community, would be a good start in knowing what we want from the game."
1461,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"Listen, I'm fps veteran and I spend all my life playing fps games. I'm global at CS:GO, Platinum in R6. Valorant is garbage, Just don't waste your time. Promise me for god's sake."
1464,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,Its boring as hell. Also it installs a rootkit as part of the anti cheat system. A mediocre game with some sketchy stuff.
1466,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,I can't believe that it's the game published in 2020. I thought it's from 2010. I wasted my 2 hours.
1468,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"this 'game' is nothing but Chinese spyware repackaged as a crap cs-go, this is now 75 characters or more"
1469,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,8,"Fantastic gameplay taking the best out CS and hero shooter genre. Graphics are minimalistic on purpose and design is great, consistent and well-thought. The only downsides are some technical issues and horrendous store prices."
1476,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,3,"i couldn't even enjoy CSGO much, but this is even worse.""Your review must be at least 75 characters long."""
1477,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"Bad graphics,    **** anti-cheats,    plagiarism    Good  Job  Riot"
1479,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"After spending over 600 hours in CSGO and 1000+ hours in Overwatch, I can wholeheartedly recommend this title. Riot games has done an outstanding job by adding the competitive aspect of CSGO with the utility abilities from Overwatch and other similar games. 10/10"
1485,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,2,"Boring, inconsistent, and soloQ experience is horrible. Also riddled with cheaters."
1486,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"The game is a combination of csgo and overwatch..,. And took the worst aspects of those games. The maps? Are absolute trash, I see that they tried something new but the format of the maps is burning trash. Too much of a rotate to mid and lack of rotate to bomb sites? This game is just utter trash"
1488,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,3,"A general lack of innovation. I kind of had a fun time, but I cannot truly support the lack of creativity on display. The worst aspects of the games Valorant ripped off are more pronounced here. Such as: An over-reliance on having competent teammates and simplistic precision shooter gameplay."
1491,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,This game is good. I played this on the closed beta and then it was realised
1492,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"It's a piss poor attempt of combining CS:GO & Overwatch. The game feels clunky and slow, not to mention that damn anti-cheat that immediately launches whenever you start your PC. Some characters are exact copies from Overwatch and it feels way too unoriginal. The graphics are meh at best.Riot Games should be ashamed of themselves to even think this would turn out to be a good game."
1494,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,1,"Might have been cool in 2008 but in 2020? Nope. This really is a game for the stupid masses and it shows. Boring gameplay, boring maps, toxic players. No thanks. There are literally 1000's of better games I can and will be playing instead. Uninstalled. At least it was free, so it gets 1 point for that."
1497,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,1,"A game with a rootkit malware doesn't get more than 1star from me ...unfortunatly i would really like to play but there's too much downs for the vanguard anti-cheat, and untill they don't solve those problems i will not play."
1498,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,Shops skin prices are a joke.71$ skin that you need to upgrade so in reality you looking at at least 100$ for a goddamn gun skin?
1500,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,trash game. vanguard crash my pc. it's very horrible and exhausted experience. i don't belive that riot games make this game.
1504,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,1,"The game isn't being review bombed as many are claiming.The game down to the core does nothing original and has a very right-winged and toxic playerbase. The game copies all of its main aspects from other games such as TF2, Overwatch and CSGO, this is just a generic clone that isnt enjoyable.1/10, nothing new, only old."
1506,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"This game is literally just a copy of cs go they could have came with something new in fps genre no they had to copy everything from CS GO,Overwatch don't play this **** game anti cheat is worst thing i've seen in 10 years"
1511,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,1,Gave 1 point because there is probably less people ruining lol now because they work on this.Also **** beta key giveaway strategy.
1515,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,1,"Really bad. Connection issues. Overwatch and CS wanna be, but not as good as either."
1518,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,Such a fun and loveable game I had a blast when I played the game yesterday i love it
1520,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,Fun game.    .
1521,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,2,"The game feels like an unsuccessful clone of cs 1.6. Poor animation, maps, uninteresting characters and extremely sucker graphics with anti-cheat that blocks the computer. If it was a game not from RIOT, then no one would ever notice it."
1522,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"its a refreshing new game that i really enjoy playing,it stands out from the competition"
1523,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,4,Terrible graphics. Horrible shooting. Boring characters.This game is out of date.
1524,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,2,"Overrated af, some elements are good most are bad, it just mixes 3 games together, very uninspired"
1525,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"Uses a spywear to brag about 'the best anticheat'. Controls are clunky, it just rides that tails of far more popular and better games.  This game is dead in a year."
1528,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"kernel ring 0 AC cant stop cheats, also doesn't uninstall with the game and runs from boot so will kill your fps in other games"
1529,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,5,"boring game, but it has potential maybe in 1 or 2 years to become really good."
1532,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"Honestly, don't listen to all these ""terrible game"" or ""overwatch/csgo clone"" gamer's. Most have probably sub"
1533,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,1,Definitely the most boring game of 2020. Who wanted a mix between Counter-Strike and Overwatch??!! The movement is so clunky and the maps are atrocious. Don't waste your time on this garbage.....
1535,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,boring. terrible graphics. horrible shooting. boring characters.this game is out of date.
1536,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,9,"Good game, but need to fix anticheat system.Huh, hater gonna hate. (hello cs-go players)"
1541,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,10,"So much trolls here. But now its allright, I calmly play this with normal ping and no bugs."
1545,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,6,A game that actually requires skill and not ability dependant easy to learn and has a high skill cealing
1553,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,3,"Good gunplay. Mediocre at everything else. Art style ugly, abilities either way op or extremely bad, map design competent but ultimately boring, intrusive anti cheat."
1554,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,4,It was kind of enjoyable for about 20 games I guess. The map design isn't very dynamic. Going back to cs.
1556,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,The gameplay was terrible the matchmaking is terrible and the most fun i had was abusing some toxic player.
1557,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,3,"Just average CS copycat game with poor graphics, but it doesn't worth to invest any time to play regularly. And Riot Games, please, fix Vanguard. If Vanguard was ok, I would give it 5 or 6."
1558,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,"The game feels like trash, dumbed down version of Counter Strike, it's basically a Chinese rip off to it. Full of cheaters and malware, it will ruin your PC and make other games don't run well."
1559,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,0,Back to 2008! This game has not brought anything new to the gaming community.  She does not have graphics and original gameplay.
1560,Anonymous,03-Jun-20,1,"Played a whole lot and all I can say this is a weak CS:GO copy with some added unnecessary skills to make the game unbalanced. It gets really boring after a short time so just skip it, their aggressive marketing on twitch burned out and it will fall into the cracks just like tft did!"
1561,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,0,Piece of crap I feel like I'm playing  a cheap clone of Overwatch and CS Go. The game is so slow and you don't feel the weapon at all . Gameplay is boring .
1562,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,0,"This games feels like brick, its like csgo but with a stick in wheels, and there a hero's, they voice lines will make you cringe, all you need to know about them. 0/10 poor copypasta from other games, and poor realization."
1563,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,1,SLOW/Corner Picking/RNG Head shots(except snipers)/Unbalanced classes&Matchmaking this game was fun for 2 hours then it turned into gambling for good teammates and bigger dmg output 1/10
1564,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,0,"It's overall bad, weapon design is hideous, matches too long with repetitive rounds."
1566,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,0,A terrible quality CS:GO plagiarism with little discrimination. Some characters' skills are exactly the same as those of certain characters in Overwatch.
1567,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,0,The pure trash. Can't believe that this has been released in 2020. Shame on you Riot.
1569,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,0,"So many bugs. Purchasing and receiving VP items etc. Game play is too long and boring.Worthless combination of previous games and very low graphic quality I understand low quality can have more player with low performance machine but, the quality and motion is horrible.Basic balance and map design are also poor. Please save your time and space of SSD."
1570,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,3,"I have spent hundreds of ours in CS:GO, Overwatch, Rainbow Six Siege. This was a horrible experience for me so far. The game isn't unique in anyway. The gameplay feels cluncky and beta like. There is zero charm in the characters. And don't get me on the skin prices..."
1571,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,0,"Vanguard smashing your computerGraphics below the levelIt makes so much company profit, but its riot technology is indie game level."
1572,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,0,"I'll summarize it  ""This is a terrible game "" .lagging, awful , clunky , boring, feels dead"
1573,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,0,Seems like a bootleg counter-strike. I honestly don't see it hitting big as it doesn't seem to have anything unique to stand out.
1575,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,5,Same **** - nothing new to highlight vs the others shooting games. Booooooooooring.
1576,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,1,What multiplayer game in 2020 doesn't support cross region can't even play it with friends cause they are on NA well i'm stuck on EU.
1578,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,8,"Maybe she might seem mediocre at the first meeting, but if you just go a little deeper into her mechanics and she starts to like! This game has a lot of potential! Riot's please add to Valorant Battle Royal, this game is just made for him! Yes, so far there are few maps and modes, but not all at once. Riot's games I wish you good luck in the development of the game! (sorry for my English)"
1582,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,9,best game shooter i ever seen. better than overwatch. better than CS go. better than anything
1583,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,10,Best game ever. They didn't take any gameplay mechanics from other games. Visual is amazing. Waiting for guns of **** 12/10
1584,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,10,The game is funThe character is cute and cartoonVanguard problem but open and resolved........
1586,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,5,This game is so so . Some strange guys think that this game kill cs go. So thanks Riot for this game  You just lost 2 years for this game (((((((
1587,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,10,The game is fantastic. I played loads during beta. Don't listen to these butthurt CS fanboys who feel threatened by new competitor.
1589,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,0,"As a CSGO player with more than 3000 hours on the game that grew tired of the broken state of CSGO, I was excited for Valorant because it was offering a cheater free experience. Sadly, Valorant is absolute garbage and it made me miss getting spin botted on CSGO."
1591,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,0,"Slow, boring, smooth yet somehow clunky, the guns feel janky, honestly it could have been made better in Gary's mod... I hope they fix it."
1592,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,1,"The graphics are ugly, I feel like I'm playing a game from the early 2000s. The game is so slow and not dynamic. In addition it is unbalanced. Lots of noise for not much."
1593,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,5,"this game is just another mediocre f2p shooter, nothing about it is interesting, and the servers are laggy as hell (i have a good internet connection trust me), zero Peeker's advantage?, zero peeker's advantage my #ss."
1594,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,3,"3/10 . I feeling empty when playing it . Stupid map designing , unbalance weapon , broken character skills and hitbox . i review after played 2 games with good K/D/A ."
1595,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,10,"This is the worst fps game for year 2020. It is just a copypaste from Overwatch and CSGO. In theory you can play this game, but it provides nothing. Graphics in this game is bad even for 2012. I played in this **** for 20 hours in beta, and in release nothing changed. Good luck."
1597,Anonymous,02-Jun-20,3,"Developers should learn the meaning of the word balance. There are not many characters in the game right now and it is very easy to balance them. They stole a lot of good points from CS:GO, but, for some reason I did not understand, they did not steal everything else, and the result was not very good."
