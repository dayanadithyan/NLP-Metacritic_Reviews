2,Anonymous,19-Feb-14,9,Simply irresistible and addictive as hell.                           
69,Anonymous,01-Sep-13,9,"Unforgiving from the get-go, but a landmark in competitive multiplayer design. [Oct 2013, p.68]                           "
142,Anonymous,15-Aug-17,9,"And this dichotomy is perhaps the best descriptor I can attach to Dota 2. It is frequently a game which occupies two opposite spaces simultaneously. It is the best game. It is also the worst game. No game has ever made me as miserable as Dota 2 has. But no game has made me feel so consistently rewarded for my time, and as consistently, wonderfully connected to the friends I play it with.                            "
234,Anonymous,06-Feb-21,10,"I wasted a lot time of my life, DOTA 2 is extremely addictive, after playing the first time, your will be drenaid slowly."
236,Anonymous,12-Dec-20,10,The best game ever. Best in its genre. Most balanced. And the best of all is that it's free to play.
239,Anonymous,25-Oct-20,10,DOTA 2 is the only game of this universe and all sorts of parallel universes. This game gives knowledge beyond the edges of the knowledge of this universe.
240,Anonymous,26-Jun-20,10,"After you get past the learning curve, this game will give you the best PvP adrenaline rush you could possibly want. Great to play with friends and challenging to play on your own. The community is extremely toxic, but the game gets very addictive, very quickly."
242,Anonymous,26-Jun-20,10,"10/10 game, but on russian server, if u did bad, everyone will f**k ur mother"
244,Anonymous,15-May-20,10,all praise the icefrog and lord gaben! best game ever if you have the time to actually learn it. anything under 500h and you won't even have scratched the surface.
247,Anonymous,04-May-20,10,"10/104,227 hrs on record -I play this game since the Warcraft 3 mod - DotADota 2 is the most complex game ever madeValve - basically created eSports with Counter Strike and Dota 2"
250,Anonymous,28-Mar-20,10,"Definitely best MOBA out there. Game is very complicated and difficult to learn for those who have never played similar games before, but in my opinion complexity is not a flaw. Due to frequent updates Dota 2 never gets repetitive and manages to adapt without changing its core aspects."
251,Anonymous,27-Mar-20,10,"I was kicked due to error of server and then banned for leaving. But it is ok, it is no like big company created that game... oh, wait...many basic errors, no optimalisation, many games of single developers are better synchronized. That is just a shame."
252,Anonymous,30-Jan-20,10,good game but as all games with team needs player balance and hero balance.
257,Anonymous,23-Nov-19,10,"Must play. I played also League of Legends, but i find dota more interresting And It has better graphics"

264,Anonymous,06-Nov-19,10,Constant perfect updates made by icefrog made this game the best MOBA add perfect graphic and nice events to this mix too
266,Anonymous,17-Mar-19,10,"Leeeeerrrrroooooyyyyy Jeeeennnnkkkkiiiinnnnssss!!!!!!But really this game is so fun if u can get into it, and although we don't have the most friendly community, there are many supportive people out there, such as the DOTA Alchemy duo, Purge and many more who try to help you become a beter player"
268,Anonymous,11-Feb-19,10,About as perfect a moba as you can find. Just beware the very steep learning curve
269,Anonymous,26-Jan-19,10,Game of life. Helps you develop a positive mental attitude. Constant changing meta keeps the game fresh.
270,Anonymous,12-Sep-18,10,"I actually can't give this game anything less than a 10 considering I've been playing DotA for about 14 years and keep coming back. Yeah, it can be frustrating, and yeah, the community is crap. But when you really strip it down, it really is just a fun game with a lot of depth."
275,Anonymous,02-Jun-18,10,Dota 2 is very nice game is too balance for skill player only .we have a little problems with cheats but valve ban him .battle pass every year is better and better  :D start dota 2 guys is very nice and balance game . No pay2win but cosmetics for those who want them. 10/10
279,Anonymous,16-Mar-18,10,"Best MOBA for hardcore players. If you need more fun and more casual, better play HotS. Now valve start to add new hero after 5 years and community happy."
282,Anonymous,01-Feb-18,10,One of the best Games ever. There is no other game i spent so much time with as I did in Dota 2. I mean by far.
284,Anonymous,09-Jan-18,10,awesome game that i have ever played. i will recommend this game to my friends
290,Anonymous,17-Dec-17,10,"Been playing for 5 years, don't plan on stopping any time soon. Originator of the game type MOBA, and immaculate execution of something so complex you'll never quite get it entirely, but satisfying every single time you try. Chess for the modern age. Welcome to Dota."
294,Anonymous,25-Nov-17,10,"This game literally changed my life. It can be toxic and infuriating at times, but this game is so rewarding in so many ways.The matchmaking rework is a welcome change and puts less weight on a specific mmr value and more on an overall experience by rewarding players with tiered badges. The rework is very similar to Rocket League's matchmaking system."
295,Anonymous,14-Jul-17,10,"Well, what can I say - 3000 hours played, this game is almost perfect...Of course the most annoying thing are other players who can be really toxic and hostile very frequently.10/10"
298,Anonymous,22-May-17,10,"Greatest ARTS game out there, with more mechanics and features than any of the other titles. The game has improved a lot since its release in 2013, thus lot of the user reviews here are quite outdated."
301,Anonymous,06-Apr-17,10,"I dont how that.....tecuyytuv yukcdvtr vytufteyu kirtyftetdrssrgfdi yjdtgdd hryurftdg jtedjjult7yrf 6edghtrsrershfn jtdtfghdtrjyjts,kdts hftdgntd jyrtygnhtdgndhgd"
306,Anonymous,13-Sep-16,10,"Played Dota since 1998, still the best game of all time; Never got bored.It requires some time to get to know the basics. The fun  is to get better with each game."
307,Anonymous,29-May-16,10,"If you don't ever want to play another game and are up to a challenge this game if for you I'm hopelessly addicted always try to play different games but always end up coming back days later. (work,family,and dota)"
308,Anonymous,12-Jan-16,10,"Very challenging, strategical, too much to understand but once you learned the mechanics it's easy, I tried a different MOBA and this is my favorite and it's the BEST EVER"
313,Anonymous,13-Nov-15,10,Very good game Very good game Very good game Very good game Very good game Very good game Very good game Very good game Very good game Very good game Very good game Very good game Very good game!!!!

Runs better than runescape.No garbo cosmetics for bigger bubbz on sniper compared to slut of legends.10/10 ignNo cap in ranked, so whos da best?"
334,Anonymous,14-Aug-15,10,Best game ever. 1500 hours omg just cant stop playing this thanks valve to give me such a great game much better than lol or any another moba recomended
335,Anonymous,28-Jul-15,10,A great PVP game and the best MMO-RPG game in the world thanks to valve we have great servers and we can play without any lag.If you trying to decide between LOL or Dota 2 then now you are looking to right game's review have fun be positive to your teammates =).
345,Anonymous,24-Jul-15,10,The Best game ever i will and gonna play in my entire life i play this game for 8 years and im still playing this game becase is the best game ever!!!
346,Anonymous,20-Jun-15,10,You are either wasting your time or winning.There are no compromises or hand holding.You hate it because you're scared to adapt.MOBAs can't get more realistic than this one.
350,Anonymous,03-Jun-15,10,"Always the best of all games, steam I'm proud of you, I played this game a 6 years ago, and now is all perfect, I never imagine that game was so awsome.For sure is the bes of all ages and times.You have to ply this game."
353,Anonymous,26-Apr-15,10,"A game hard to master but with an amazing sense of reward! Cyka Blyat and privet rule EU servers which is always fun! A game that contributes into a roller-coast and funky but worthy dementia. Welcome into the rabbit hole, we can only hope you can't get out anymore!"
354,Anonymous,03-Apr-15,10,"Beginners are screwed at first, but eventually they will discover a new, extremely satisfying level of gameplay. Dota 2 is an amazing game because of its strategic depth, constantly varying games, and established highly competitive scene. This game generates challenges both for the casual and the more serious player."
365,Anonymous,20-Feb-15,10,This game is wonderful with so much depth that even after over 8 years of playing it I still have much to learn. But all of that depth and beauty is ruined by the horrible community. If you want to enjoy this game and have fun it's best to play with friends. Otherwise be ready for a lot of frustration if you play solo.
374,Anonymous,16-Feb-15,10,"Started my first game, client recommended that I play some bot games to learn as I started out, I said ""Awww, nah, I'll just jump into normal matchmaking"". Immediately lost 10 games in a row, and was subject to an entire life's worth of abuse and reports for being a noob. 700 hours later I do not regret my decision.11/10, would get flamed again."
377,Anonymous,12-Feb-15,10,"It's one of the best, I really love this game. I hope they will add more heroes and maps to the game. There are over 90 heroes to choose from currently, and it's truly competitive games I've ever played."
378,Anonymous,03-Feb-15,10,"Addictively fun clickfest mixed with crushing frustration. If there was a symbol to describe the feeling you get playing Dota 2, it would be the yin-yang. A balance of good and bad elements that create an epic game. It is hard to properly describe a game that has acended to this height of audacious creativity. One can only stand and stare in awe."
379,Anonymous,05-Jan-15,10,"BEST GAME IN STEAM,BEST GAME IN PC for you guys that hate this at least learn how to play i wonder why soo many peps hate this its free you dont need to use money/play 1 hour to unlock heroes,thank you gabe newell"
382,Anonymous,25-Dec-14,10,"nice but it's all just about game, don't be serious. sometime you need to back in your life. game is game, your life must go on. chase what you want. But for overall. it's very nice game. i really enjoy play this game. Just try , and let your brain make a good way to be a winner."
383,Anonymous,24-Nov-14,10,"I have played over 450 hours of this game and it never gets boring, its a great free to play game that the things you buy in game have no effect of how good you are at the game, by far, the best free to play game ever."
385,Anonymous,20-Nov-14,10,Absolutely brilliant game that pioneered and defined the MOBA genre. Best of its kind and the most difficult too; new users may have trouble acclimating to the level of competitiveness.But it's an absolutely excellent game. At least try it!
392,Anonymous,13-Nov-14,10,"Within a year, I could speak fluent peruvian and russian.In all seriousness, Dota 2 is a highly addictive real time strategy game. It looks beautiful and is very rewarding. Hard to learn, hard to master. I definitely recommend it to anyone.10/10"
395,Anonymous,11-Nov-14,10,"- Hard as hell, require skill and brain .... check- ""Good"" matchmaking system ... check- Servers full of !@#$%^& noob / re!@#$ (sorry if this is offensive) russians, pinoys and peruvians ... check- Nice cosmetic system ... check- And last one: ""Fun? You must be new""10/10 would play again"
397,Anonymous,08-Nov-14,10,"This is a game that I thoroughly enjoy playing. It uses RTS (Real Time Strategy) in a fun, exciting and very challenging way. The only real problem is the largely volatile community, but that is found in all games of this kind (LoL, for example). Overall: a very well-developed, well-polished game that fully deserves 10/10."
403,Anonymous,05-Nov-14,10,"A really great online battle game, loads of depth, lots of heroes and lots of replay-ability. Very nice business model in that you only really pay for vanity gear, just wish they updated the game a bit more regularly. Still a 10 from me due to the sheer value for money and quality of the product."
405,Anonymous,21-Oct-14,10,"Its a MOBA, the father os MOBAs; a nice one. The game its hard as hell, and require friends to play. One of the excellent thing, its free; real free. You download the game, and play it. Its not for everyone."
409,Anonymous,18-Sep-14,10,"Seriously awesome game, even though it's a bit addictive, so watch out for that.- Not ONE gameplay aspect requires payment.On a sidenote though, this game is more about competition than it is about ""fun"", and while playing it you may find yourself on a toxic environment, this being especially true for new players."
410,Anonymous,13-Sep-14,10,"I have often normally had the ""high five"" with Sweetie Pearl J. Padilla and Maegan Ysabelle M. Belardo from Academy of Jesus by playing favorites with heroes with Naga Siren (Slithice), Moon Rider (Luna), and Skywrath Mage (Dragonus)."
411,Anonymous,07-Sep-14,10,"Best game so far. A real time strategy packed with action ... it's ARTS ! The game have many strategies and combo you can do with heroes. The game is not a pay to win game, so you will only find cosmetics to buy or anythings related to this."
417,Anonymous,30-Aug-14,10,The best MOBA game!! Awesome graphics and animations!!! Also very helpfull with the new players!!  You can win with your skills and not with your money!!!
418,Anonymous,13-Aug-14,10,I've played this game for 273 hours and I think this game is great with good replay value but its gets competitive quick + it becomes a race for the toxic heroes or for there counters but its worth playing if you like mobas
419,Anonymous,11-Aug-14,10,"Awesome game needs time to learn but at all its just god damn awesome, i would everybody recommend to play it if u like MOBAS/ARTS i go about 3k hours now and i will play way more :) awesome!. Btw the company is talented not like riot haha, i mean the content patches are AWESOME and big"
420,Anonymous,11-Aug-14,10,Certainly the most addictive game I played. I love the minimalist core concept combined with an almost unlimited depth. If you play it (semi-)regularly with a team consisting of friends it's at its best. A competitive game avec brio!
421,Anonymous,08-Aug-14,10,"This is totally my favorite game of my favorite genre. Lots of characters, lots of items, lots of strategies and, of course, lots of fun! Graphics were improved since Warcraft Dota, too."
424,Anonymous,03-Aug-14,10,"Playing this over 10 god damn years. Still not done yet - game to freakin deep - the neverstopping process of learning new, analysing data, mastering all the little aspects will literally drive you nuts if you brain loves to keep working. But nobody forces you to - you can just have fun like most of the players do."
425,Anonymous,27-Jul-14,10,Fantastic game. The graphics and cg are amazing. Though the tutorials might be a bit confusing for people who have never played dota1 or similar games.
426,Anonymous,12-Jul-14,10,"Best free to play game in a true sense. There's no need to buy new heroes, no Pay-to-win issue at all. The game is absolutely fantastic especially after Valve has been putting focus on server stability, balance and the most importantly, community. It's amazing how the game has been improved since its first Beta launch back in 2011."
427,Anonymous,08-Jul-14,10,"MOBA is a terrible genre name, but that being said, this is easily the best of the genre. The most balanced by far with the highest skill ceiling.Aside from the gameplay, Valve does a great job keeping it updated and working, it has one of the best clients i've seen in a multiplayer video game in a while"
431,Anonymous,06-Jul-14,10,"10/10 Best language learning tool EVER. Makes Rosetta Stone look like a JOKE. Available in Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and every language in the European Union."
432,Anonymous,02-Jul-14,10,"Best MOBA there is. Graphics are much better than it's competitors (LoL), it's not full of 9 year olds (LoL), it's not pay to win (LoL), and it doesnt take 3 3rd party DRMs to play (LoL). It may be hard at first, but it gets easier.Also $10,000,000 international prizepool."
434,Anonymous,02-Jul-14,10,"the best game in the world... ""One of the best, most difficult and truly competitive games I've ever played. It is free and doesn't have any pay-to-win, all heroes are free, the only paid content are cosmetical items that DO NOT change gameplay."" nuff said"
436,Anonymous,01-Jul-14,10,The MOBA that every gamer should try for at least a few hours. DoTA is nearly ten years old and is the wisest of all the MOBAs. Each hero is playable and competitive and patches are carefully balanced on buffs and nerfs. Heroes aren't nerfed for being the flavor of the month and are still competitive after getting nerfed a wee bit.
437,Anonymous,05-Jun-14,10,"This game is for old DOTA players, not friendly at all to newbie. But it's a lot of fun. The game improved a lot fo stuff from the original DOTA, and making the game play super fluent. Skills and experience are important. Players can enjoy the games for a very long time, and never get the feeling of repetition."
440,Anonymous,05-Jun-14,10,"I may not the the biggest fan of this game. But sorry for saying, the idiots who spammed with 0s and ""diretide"" really pity me. I want to give at least this 10 of mine to fix the curve maybe a tiny bit..."
441,Anonymous,05-Jun-14,10,"Best game i've ever played!!And it's also addictive as hell, I've played it for more than 1600 hours and I still have many things to learn and increase, love this game!!"
442,Anonymous,29-May-14,10,"One of the best games I've ever played. These is so much depth to the gameplay that comes into play each game- positioning, item choice, farming, team composition, etc.Not an easy game to get into and far from simple to master, but very satisfying. 10/10 been playing for a year and will likely continue to play for a long time."
445,Anonymous,28-May-14,10,This is the OG of Moba's. The depth of this game puts it on a level far about the Moba's that have come after it. If you want true Moba immersion Dota 2 is the game you want.
447,Anonymous,14-May-14,10,Great game. Discount the negative reviews. All of them were made by idiots. This game has improved a lot in the 3 years its been available to the public. Amazing voice acting. Amazing visual effects.
449,Anonymous,11-May-14,10,This game is so addictive. There are over 50 heroes that you can choose. this game requires skill and good technique to play it.  I recommend this game also for new comers. Give this game a try and don't hesitate while playing it and you for sure will love it.
451,Anonymous,02-May-14,10,"I'm an avid fan of DotA.Valve did a great job recreating DotA *well... some of it*! *Thumbs up*+ Competitive- Hard Learning curve for newbies+ Heroes are open to pick unlike the other game *BOOOOOO*+ Free to Play! It only has cosmetic items, no paid advantage!""Easy to learn, Hard to master"""
455,Anonymous,28-Apr-14,10,Definitely one of the best games i've ever played. I started out playing LoL but tried out dota and it turned out to be great! I love it. It's especially fun to play with your friends if you are 5. It makes it more fun and give you more teamplay and you will win easily! Try it!
456,Anonymous,24-Apr-14,10,"This game ruined my life! Very addictive and irresistible. Been playing dota for 10 years now and dota 2 just made it more great. The graphics, the art style, pvp matching actions, and more just made it more great . I quit several times but still I keep coming back. There's something in this game that keeps us coming back and get more hyped. I recommend it to every hardcore gamers out there."
457,Anonymous,12-Apr-14,10,Theres a reason this is the most played PC game of all time as of the moment. The first few games suck yes but when you learn you cant put it down. If one person on your team feeds you lose but i dont have a problem with losing i still have fun. A game can take from 20mins to 1 or so hours its a joy to play with friends i recommend it highly. 10/10 Ruined my life.
460,Anonymous,04-Apr-14,10,The best game ever...IceFrog idea of a competitive game has been taken to the next level with Valves support and built a whole world up around it.Many hours spent playing this game and I see many many more coming.
462,Anonymous,22-Mar-14,10,They delivered diretide. They delivered diretide. They delivered diretide. They delivered diretide. They delivered diretide. They delivered diretide. They delivered diretide.
463,Anonymous,14-Mar-14,10,"One of the best game I've ever played, even though learning curve is really high it still gives lots of fun.For some reasons I heard that this game is really imbalanced, probably because it's mostly directed to competitive scene."
467,Anonymous,23-Feb-14,10,"Probably the best game ever made, gj valve.Probably the best game ever made, gj valve.Probably the best game ever made, gj valve.Probably the best game ever made, gj valve."
468,Anonymous,17-Feb-14,10,"I had so much fun punching elephants to death when i wasnt stunned. I got some good punches on this fat ass elephant but not many because everyone has a stun. Worst lego game ever. I might aswell go watch the lego movie coming out in the cinemas because im a 12 year old. either way, dota 2 sucks big black galaxy bars."
470,Anonymous,02-Feb-14,10,"I like dis game very much. I wait long time, but Volvo giff me diretide and new character to play with. Game is not dead anymore. Thank you Volvo, I buy your car and game for long time."
479,Anonymous,28-Jan-14,10,Its a very good game. I started playing since the beta about 1 and a half year ago. Its true that its hard to master the game but Its very interesting and fun to master each hero. As you get to learn that each character is situational and not the same. I have become addicted to it and i find it as my favorite Action RTS.
481,Anonymous,27-Jan-14,10,"Negative points just come from the delay Diretide event. People are not really mean. Great graphics, best RPG gameplay, great metagame. E-sport game of the year 2013. Enough said!"
482,Anonymous,27-Jan-14,10,"Amazing gaming, VERY difficult to learn but amazingly rewarding when you start to understand the mechanics and using little details that can turn the tide of a game on the long run."
483,Anonymous,09-Jan-14,10,"Many blame the game for its horrible community. It is indeed rude and childish, but to blame the game itself for it would be pointless. As for the game itself, it's pointless to rate a free-to-play product of such quality and stability lower that 10, as Valve has done tremendous job to preserve DotA into Source engine and introduce new elements which help attract new players and old players alike."
486,Anonymous,24-Dec-13,10,"The game is nice   very close to the original dota  witch i loved). the game is much more complex from LoL so at first it is a little hard   but i like it when its hard) the game has  some way to go but its a very good game, just give it a chance "
489,Anonymous,24-Dec-13,10,"This game is one of the most skill intensive games out there. The team dynamic is crucial to do well and the game play is fun and highly addicting. If your looking for a game to really submerse yourself into, then this is it."
490,Anonymous,24-Dec-13,10,"Best game made in the last years, thank you for picking up a bootleg WC3 mod we all loved and got hooked! dismemberd! and life stolen by! Thank you Valve"
491,Anonymous,24-Dec-13,10,"Complex, competitive, fun and loads of teamwork. Different play styles can lead to victories or defeat with heavy punishments for small mistakes. A single team fight can change the whole course of the game. With varied controls and a huge amount of heroes to play, any combination of skills and items can be possible. DOTA 2, a very good experience and takes a lifetime to master."
492,Anonymous,22-Dec-13,10,"All in all this game is a good  one.Since the first beta days there was a large improvement.As a result you have a normally balanced gameplay, a lot of heroes to choose, different events and a lot of patches.Valve has proved that they know how to create a real special game."
493,Anonymous,19-Dec-13,10,It's so sad that a lot of people put negative comments in this great game all because of Diretide. Otherwise very good game. New player here and extremely pleased at how well made the game is. Good job Valve.
494,Anonymous,19-Dec-13,10,"Free game, awesome updates and great community. The micro transactions give you no advantage in game which is awesome. Also there are constant updates to make the interface fresh."
495,Anonymous,18-Dec-13,10,"If you want real MOBA, this is. If you just want to think you are good at MOBA, go play LoL.There is a reason that even Blizzard is going to copy Dota"
497,Anonymous,16-Dec-13,10,"I give this game a 9.5, but it is closer to a 10 so I'll give it that. It is also to offset the idiots that think giving a game anything at or below a 3 is appropriate. It is a lot of fun and is the most complex MOBA out there in my opinion. However, I will stick to LoL for my more casual party games with friends, but Dota is a great hardcore game."
499,Anonymous,12-Dec-13,10,"A game that has been refined for over 10 years as a mod for warcraft3 then ported to new light with the care and consideration that only valve can afford, always listening to the community and always refining their games no matter how old they get (e.g. TF2, Counter Strike).DotA couldn't have asked for a better developer to refine it."
500,Anonymous,11-Dec-13,10,Such a wonderfully crafted and beautiful game. Every match is different and fun. There is a lot of depth but with some dedication you really start to appreciate the game's complexity and balance.
502,Anonymous,11-Dec-13,10,GOD  The best Game ever for MultiplayerBetter than StarCraft  LOL or othersFor me is The best Game everYou can try to play any char you will found a good way to win 
503,Anonymous,09-Dec-13,10,"Steep learning curve, and I say this even though I played Dota1 for 2 years back when I played wc3. Incredibly rewarding teambased strategy game. Wouldn't recommend playing it by yourself, but the most fun i've had playing a competitive game in years. What Valve is doing for the growth of Dota2 in Esports as well is amazing!"
504,Anonymous,08-Dec-13,10,1 word  perfection i started playing dota 1 like 4 years ago and stopped for a while but when dota 2 came out i regained my passion toward that game and got addicted back to it  i'm still playing this awesome game and enjoying the actual features with hope that valve gives us more in the close future :D keep up the good work volvo
507,Anonymous,07-Dec-13,10,"Amazing  epic, fantastic game, ive spent hours playing this beauty, its everything i want in a game and more. Cant wait till TI4. It is a very difficult game to learn. Ive been playing for over 10 years and cant claim ive mastered it in any way. Its worth it though. Love this game!"
508,Anonymous,03-Dec-13,10,There's 2 things about Dota 2 it's completely free and it's developed by VALVe. If that's not enough for you to try this game I don't know what is. The only thing that you have to spend in order to play this game is time.
510,Anonymous,02-Dec-13,10,Its good. Its free. And I all hero characters are available to play whenever unlike its overly expensive rival game League of Legends. Also volvo gave diretide so...
511,Anonymous,01-Dec-13,10,"This game is offering every fun factor that Dota-like genre can offer.Perfect models, voice works, graphics, effects....and boxes too.I want to give score 100!"

513,Anonymous,27-Nov-13,10,"Excellent player-map interaction compared to similar game. Good balance and selection. Easily superior to League and Heroes, but unfortunately not as widespread. However, that situation is rapidly improving."
514,Anonymous,27-Nov-13,10,"Warcraft 3 DOTA wasn't developed to make money. DOTA 2 is identical to Warcraft 3 DOTA. The most unique game I can think of. Can be played in any way you'd like. Requires an enormous time-sink to fully appreciate. However, once mastered on an indivual level and once you're in a synchronised team, it's the most rewarding varied and competitive multiplayer game that exist within it's genre."
515,Anonymous,24-Nov-13,10,"You can ignore all the LOL fans who's best attempt to criticize the game fail just like TrueTrueReview did when giving it a 0 because it's copied Dota. Of course it copied Dota, that's the point of it. The original creator of the  WC3 mod, icefrog, ported his baby to on a modern engine. It's truest and best dota clone and deserves a 9.5 and a 10 if  they every improve the match making algo."
516,Anonymous,23-Nov-13,10,"After 6 years of dota i can say this is the best game i have ever played. More than 3000 houres of gameplay and playing is still fun. I realy enjoy dota 2! I am rly exited for the ""new"" heros and some realy new stuff. "
517,Anonymous,22-Nov-13,10,"It's not a noob friendly game, which explains many of the negative reviews along with the immature, shortsighted diretide idiots that ruined the rating of their beloved game. Best Dota type game out there, so  it should be a 8 or  9. Giving 10 to  compensate  for idiots."

Takes a bit to get started with, but definitely worth it down the road. 10/10"

524,Anonymous,18-Nov-13,10,"Of all the ARTS games out there, DotA 2 is far and away the best. The low user score comes from LOL fan boyz and diretide morons. The learning curve is steep, but once you learn, you'll see it's the deepest and most  beautiful game ever made."
526,Anonymous,18-Nov-13,10,"Just wanted to say that all the negatives reviewers are people who play league of legends and this is a great game, some what of a learning curve compared to league but eventually very easy to get into."
527,Anonymous,18-Nov-13,10,"Awesome game, great competitive gameplay with endless replayability. Im just trying to reduce the damage done by the ""give diretide"" retards and return it to a fair review"
528,Anonymous,17-Nov-13,10,"If you want to get the most out of this game, you have to invest the time to play the tutorial and a few bot matches offline. If you make that investment to learn how to play, it will pay off with the most wonderful online experience in existence. No other game compares to Dota 2."
530,Anonymous,17-Nov-13,10,"As Shinsena writes ""Valve releases one great game"" but then goes on to give it a ZERO because he had a few unfair  matches. No this game deserves a 9+ as it's a GOTY, so I'll give it a 10. If you have suggestion to improve it, use the steam forum not here."
532,Anonymous,17-Nov-13,10,Only defect is the rancid community. But this game is the actual standard for F2P model and listen users. 10/10 without dude. Valve always develop serious products
536,Anonymous,16-Nov-13,10,Dota 2 is a really fun Game i have about 1000 hours played and its still fun. The community is really easy to anger abd they have no patience. The user score should be a 9 but because of a delayed update they all went on rage mode.
538,Anonymous,16-Nov-13,10,I Love the Game. No pay to win.Well balanced  Good graphic. And most of all good Game-play.You have to like the genre. Then the game will be  perfectly for you.
539,Anonymous,16-Nov-13,10,"This is currently my favorite game. If you invest the time, you'll find it's the deepest of all the DotA clones out today. It's too bad, a few idiots choose to hurt the score instead of using  the proper channels to beg Valve for free content."
541,Anonymous,16-Nov-13,10,Don't listen to all the stupid kids that use Metacritic to complain about minor issues and hurt the score of the game they love. Ignore all retarded posts that say give diretide or volvo. Play this awesome game!
543,Anonymous,15-Nov-13,10,Amazing game with awesome features. Perfect upgrade from DOTA1. Valve is putting in tons of effort and it is paying off. I can play this game 100% for free every single day. New content comes regularly and they make a point of keeping the quality high.
544,Anonymous,15-Nov-13,10,"This is incredible game. This is strategy and action game at the same time! And this is Valve game. All valve's game the best of the world. 10/10, the Best!"
545,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"This is one of my favorite games. For paid games, it deserves a 8+, but as a free game it should have a 9+ rating. Don't listen to the spoiled kids who feel entitled to to free content for a game they didn't pay for. Play this game, you'll love it!"
550,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"volvo gave diretide. love restored.In all seriousness, don't let the lowish user score fool you, this is a great game and the community loves the devs, and the devs love them back."
551,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,For me this game is a 10/10 but it is my personal opinion i do believe that there are many flaws but i assure you that if you like this type of game you will fall in love with like i have.So i hope that valve continue working on making the game better and fixing all the flaw it has so that 10 becomes true 
552,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,This game is amazing! One of the best and most polished games i've played ever. This game improved so much since it was released on the beta. There are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as DOTA 1.
553,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"After playing League of Legends, Heroes of Newerth, Dota and Dota-2, Dota-2 in my opinion is the best choice, you have every Hero available from the beginning and is a bit more difficult than the others (instead of Dota of course) So if you're looking for a challenging MOBA/ARTS Dota-2 is perfect for you"
554,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"Nice game. THis is game is really awesome. In every aspect. So much better than lol, and hon. but Lol sucks more than hon. I don't even know how good that smite  is, but I think it's better than lol. because Lol sucks ballz. and Dota 2 is bezt."
559,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"best AoS-style game out there. way more complex and rewarding than games like league of legends, and valve is one of the best developers of games ever."
561,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"Dota 2 is excellent. Although it has a large learning curve, once you get past that it is addictive and fun. I haven't had much trouble with the community, sure there are flamers every once in a while, but I can't remember the last time I have been in a game with flamers. Excellent game. Give it a shot."
562,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"Simply awesome,cant stop playing it .Highly detailed,deep,engaging,balanced but most of all what makes this great is the amount of love developers have shown and the amount of love the players of dota and fans have shown that makes it truely great."
568,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"Much much much better than lol In addition, it is F2P which is amazing. And unlike, LoL or HoN which require you to use a rotating hero list until you buy your own with real money or accumulate enough in-game currency to purchase a single hero,"
571,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"Great game, great mechanics, awesome community.VALVe did a really good job with the updates, a bit late, but worth it the waitToday 11/14/13, we got 2 new heroes (Ember and Earth spirit), we got diretide, we got a new re-work on Storm spirit wich looks awesome, we got a bunch of new items, we got EVERYTHING10/10"
574,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"Great game, a lot of diversity.  Impossible to master 100+ heroes, so there's always room for improvement.    Fan base needs to calm down a bit, though, before lashing out irrationally (Diretide Apocalypse)."
575,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"Frustrating at times because of the players, but a perfect game. Constant support and backed by Valve. It has a steep learning curve as a MOBA but it's very worth it. There are tons of guides and videos to get started."
576,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,This game is amazing. Seriously. The best game ever made. Unfortunately it has the hardest skill curve around and a horrendous community at times (which you can see from the 3389 negative reviews about  Diretide). Dota players can be real 
578,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"Diretide delivered. 10 delivered.Also: after 1000+ hours in games, still great game. Almost every aspect of game is... 1 5 0 char limit. Just 1 more"
580,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"Its a good game, people giving it bad rating only because the DireTide event was delayed and they didnt release Technies. But ignore them, Dota 2 is a very good game."
584,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"unded gaem, volvo reband.but seriously, this is the most fun game i have played, ever. it does have a steep learning curve, but you will always be matched against similarly skilled players."
586,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,A great PvP game that offers some of the most intriguing and nuanced team combat around. Very hard learning curve but the satisfaction that you get when u actually master the game is so good
589,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"one of the best games ever made. definitely worth playing. First of it's genre, with amazing gameplay. Game that lasted for more than a decade. And it's much more beautiful than first part!"
590,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"Great game! Don't be fooled by the 1% of the idiots who ruined the score because of something stupid, valve gave us a great game and lets hope that it goes the distance!"
592,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"Pros:- seemingly infinite strategical aspects (!)- complex gameplay and mechanics- a thriving, international competitive scene- free to play- never gets boring (Really. I've been playing Dota 2 and it's precursor for 5-6 years now.)Cons:- steep learning curve- as in every multiplayer game, some people you encounter can be rude"
593,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,Bumping the score because people went mad about diretide not going live. Now that it will be available in the upcoming patch there is no reason to keep those negative scores.
595,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,DOTA 2 is the best game in its genre due to the variety of heroes and game modes it provides and most importantly  it's free without any pay-to-win features. Matchmaking system needs some improvement but other than that it's flaws are minimal.
596,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"Best  (Aeon of Strife Styled Fortress Assualt Game Going on Two Sides) game out there. 3 spirits update shows how amazing Dota 2 is, and how much support valve gives it. I could write a much longer in-depth review, but im simply here to boost the score after it was assaulted by give diretide babies."

602,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"I can't get over how fun this game is.  It's a game of fencing, where you give a little and take a little. It's back and forth fun all game and there is no better developer than Valve"

614,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,This game is great because of its steep learning curve and a vast variety of heroes and strategies. Anyone who likes MOBA -type games should love Dota 2.
615,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,Basically the best MOBA/Action-RTS game ever made to this point in time.Too bad it's metascore is demolished by a bad part of it's community begging for a random Halloween event...
616,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"Been playing since 6.59 on WarCraft 3. This is the perfect successor for our beloved Game. The graphics are stunning, and is really optimized for low end PC' s.The community could use some kindness... but playing with some friends helps with that. 10/10"
617,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"Though exceptionally hard to master, Dota 2 delivers a strangely balanced, highly competitive, endlessly entertaining multiplayer experience. Just make sure you have the patience, and time to learn."
618,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,This game is amazing if you ever played WC3Dota you should play this!! I played it since beta version. Loved how valve took wc3dota and turned into this marvelous thing. Thank You Valve!!
621,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"Always updating every month or so with amazing amounts of new content and new user and community features. I don't know a better game that continues pushing new content for free. Also, DotA 2 always refines and revamp older characters so they don't get forgotten, new skins and HD remodeling as well "
624,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"The best moba game now. Have the biggest map, some systems like up/down adventage, day and night vision are great. Heroes are really free balanced and intresting. Every are diffrent. Updates are smart and good."
630,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"Amazing, I haven't looked back at Dota 1 since I first got into the beta, that says alot about how Valve captured Everything important whilst still improving upon the game tremendously"
631,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"Game is good, matchmaking system blows, lots of glitches Valve won't fix, slow updates, but the game itself is good and this is just to counteract the 0's being handed out thanks to the lack of Diretide which is here now."
632,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"Best game out there, Valve also started communicate with the community. Awesome work lately and I'm looking forward to play the new heroes and trying out the new crafting, gemming etc!"

646,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,Only no skilled noobs play diretide. Yes you are noobs and you should go play Leauge of Legends. Intentionally giving bad reviews for a reason like this can only be a work of a retarded individuals.
647,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"Awesome update has been given. Even though Valve doesn't communicate really well to the community, but never underestimate them, they are silencing because they wanna focus for this mega update.VALVe  plus IceFrog equal BEYOND GODLIKE!"
649,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"I've played many games with class based systems and what have you, and they all have major imbalances. The fact that DotA manages to have such finely tuned balanced with the ridiculous amount of heroes is nothing short of amazing. An incredibly fun, balanced, polished game that is completely free to play. What more can you ask for? Play it."
654,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,Having played the MOBA genre for over 5 years I would not hesitate to recommend or even talk someone into trying this game over others of it's genre (namely LoL and Smite etc). Dota 2 and HoN are my two favourite games throughout my gaming history and both games easily immerse you in it's play for countless hours of entertainment.
656,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"Dota 2 has to be the best F2P game out there. It is very complex and there's always more to learn about it but once you learn the basics, it's incredibly rewarding and fun to play."
658,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"dota 2 10/10 the best game from the time of Jesus' birth .I play DotA since Alexander the Great and I'm still not tired of it. One of the best, most difficult and truly competitive games I've ever played. It is free and doesn't have any pay-to-win, all heroes are free"
659,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"Best free to play game in a true sense. There's no need to buy new heroes, no Pay-to-win issue at all. The game is absolutely fantastic especially after Valve has been putting focus on server stability, balance and the most importantly, community. It's amazing how the game has been improved since its first Beta launch back in 2011. I've played Dota 1, LoL, HoN, and Smite"
663,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,10,"One of the best, most difficult and truly competitive games I've ever played. It is free and doesn't have any pay-to-win, all heroes are free, the only paid content are cosmetical items that DO NOT change gameplay."

677,Anonymous,13-Nov-13,10,So much affrf since it was released on the beta. There are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as DOTA 1. I know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in DOTA 2 and I think it will help new comers.
678,Anonymous,13-Nov-13,10,"I have spent over 1000 hours playing this game and none of them were wasted.  Every match is as fresh and fun as the first one you play. Even though you may lose a lot of games when you get a killing spree, nothing in gaming compares to it. Great game, well worth the $0 you pay for it."
681,Anonymous,13-Nov-13,10,Been playing since beta and still cant get enough of this game.. I've tried other games like HoN and LOL but neither can match the intricacy and depth as well as graphics. Very happy with the way Valve is running things and am glad to see big gaming companies sponsoring tournaments to grow the game.
683,Anonymous,13-Nov-13,10,All the diretide  got pissed over an update that valve never said they were even doing in the first place. Dota 2 is the  and don't let anyone else tell you otherwise.

716,Anonymous,11-Nov-13,10,"Really awesome game. Despite some whining people (with big ego) says, if you are a noob you will play with noobs, and if you really are good, you will play with very high skilled people (sometimes even with pro players) keep it up Valve!"
717,Anonymous,11-Nov-13,10,"This is a free-to-play game that does NOT require *ANY* money at all. More than that: Spending *ANY* amount of money in this game will give you absolutely ZERO competitive advantage against other players. Spend $10,000 if you can, go right ahead. You will gain only a variety of cosmetic items."
718,Anonymous,11-Nov-13,10,"This game is certainly worth playing. It's free yet very entertaining and joyful, hard, complicated and requires a calm mind and firm strategy. If you're up for challenge   download dota on steam and start playing. it's hard but rewarding"

741,Anonymous,11-Nov-13,10,"Honestly, it is the greatest game I've ever played. I was not into this genre years ago, and now Dota is essentially all I play. It's a shame the immature members of the community felt the need to bomb the Metacritic score over something trivial like the Diretide. I hope we can bring the score back up where it belongs."

748,Anonymous,11-Nov-13,10,"Don't go by the negative reviews, its because valve didn't make an announcement regarding an event. This is a AAA game for free with a steep learning curve. However, once you learn it, its never ending fun."
749,Anonymous,11-Nov-13,10,"Truly the best moba, if not PC game, ever, out there.On a true 5v5 neutral basis, without pay for power of any kind and all heroes available from the very first time you launch the game, this title holds no comptetitors worthy of the name."
750,Anonymous,11-Nov-13,10,Very time consuming. Well done graphics and animations. Large amount of tradeable items. The replay value is enormous because there are so many heroes to use.

770,Anonymous,10-Nov-13,10,"Great game, amazing complexity, really love it. Only problem is that its, so addictive, but is that a problem really? The game is incredibly well made, and Valve is doing a great job of catering both casual and more hardcore gamers with this. A must-play!"
772,Anonymous,10-Nov-13,10,I don't know how else to describe this game other than the fact that it is a masterpiece. I have played this game for years and there's always something about this game that just keeps bringing me back for more. It is beyond one of the best games that I will ever play and i would suggest this game to anyone.
773,Anonymous,10-Nov-13,10,"Amazing game, steep learning curve, but tons of fun once you get a hang of it. Spent countless hours/days playing with friends. Great community and support from Valve"

776,Anonymous,10-Nov-13,10,The most challenging MOBA style game out there. Great fun with friends. Regular updates. Great business model (completely free to play with JUST cosmetic items for sale). Play it!
779,Anonymous,10-Nov-13,10,"Great game. Wonderful graphics. Good deep mechanics. More complicated and diverse than League of Legends. Takes a higher level of knowledge to greatly understand the game. Heroes are very unique and diverse from one another, you will never think one is like another."

785,Anonymous,10-Nov-13,10,"Excellent game, with much more sophisticated mechanics than LoL.There's 2 things about Dota 2 it's completely free and it's developed by VALVe. If that's not enough for you to try this game I don't know what is. The only thing that you have to spend in order to play this game is time. That's right, Dota 2 is not like most other games and that's because it's very complex, so be patient"
786,Anonymous,10-Nov-13,10,"Immensely rewarding, infinitely complex, irresponsibly long nights. Dota 2 is the pinnacle of team based multiplayer competition. Nothing else available comes close."
789,Anonymous,10-Nov-13,10,Such a great game. Love the fact that its not only free but every single character is unlocked from the start. There's no fremium nonsense that requires you to play obsurdly long or buy characters. The gameplay is fantastic and is my favorite MOBA if not my favorite game right now. Valve is doing it right and I couldn't ask for anything more out of them.
792,Anonymous,10-Nov-13,10,Dota 2 is an awesome game that I'll play for a long time onwards. The game and all content affecting the gameplay is completely free of charge. Try it out!

800,Anonymous,10-Nov-13,10,"Fantastic game, really addicting, tons of features. Plus, all the heroes are free from the start. The only thing you pay for is cosmetics that only change the look of the characters, but the gameplay is completely unaffected by these cosmetics. Really fun game to play, especially with friends."

813,Anonymous,10-Nov-13,10,"A game that keeps challenges you so much that there's something new to learn every time you play. Even after having well over 1000 hours of playing the game and spectating pro tournaments, this is just a gold mine for fans of team games that require deep strategic thinking and fast reflexes at the same time."

818,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Before this game, I'd never played a moba, and it does take a steep learning curve. But giving it a bit of effort, I began to understand the mechanics and then this game became incredibly addicting. And thats because it is a good game, and you should try it."
819,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,I love this game and i think there is no use in writing how good the game is but last week people were putting zeros to Dota2 and i find it unfair because they were crying about Diretide
820,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"FInally valve did something to please. Check it in the internet, just wanted to revert my quote. Go download this great game., on my opinion its the best moba out there today"
821,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,With the steep learning curve i find this to be one of the most rewarding online pvp games around. Great level of skill and ability is required and communication key to becoming a good team member. All in all a brilliant game by valve
822,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Complex mechanics that are fun to learn, hard to master.  Amazing artwork across the entire game.  Constant updates that keep the game fresh.  One of the best ever created."
823,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Well done Valve.Dota 2 is one of the best games one can play, ever. Possible to get lost playing it for weeks and months on end. Learning curve is steep and that's what makes it fun."
825,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Best MOBA game out, hands down. The depth and intricacy of the gameplay far excel any competitors on the market. This does result in a steep learning curve but those who stick it out are rewarded with a deep and engaging game."
826,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"1600 hours in, not a single  regret. Feels like i've scratched the surface, haha!After getting this game, i haven't played any singleplayer games, totally hooked on this. It just seems every match of dota tells a better story than any game could.I really can't see myself getting bored of it ever."
827,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Best game ever! True multiplayer masterpiece. Well balanced heroes, every match provides great amount of emotions. Music and sounds are very nice (awesome voice acting!). Graphics are well made. Recommending to every person who want to try a MOBA-like game. Playing with friends is even better experience!"
829,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Incredible and well developed game, only brought down in ratings by an immature reddit community, League of legends fanboys and people who don't understand the game or that the items are cosmetic only and it is a completely free to play"
831,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"honestly this is one of the most sick game ever created. Lots of heroes, strategy, possibility, fun...the only paid content are cosmetical items that DO NOT change gameplay."
832,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Easily one of the best games I've ever played. It's especially fun when you have friends that play as well.A lot of reviews on this site are negative but don't mind the trolls. There are still some good people in the dota community. That being said,  try it out and i assure you won't regret it."
834,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"honestly this is one of the most sick game ever created. Lots of heroes, strategy, possibility, fun... i can't understand why some people would spam 0's just because they didn't get Diretide (which is coming tho). That was really bad and i hope this user score will reflect the real value of the game, which is 10"
835,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"It's a really good game, possible the best game I've ever played. It have a good mixture of strategy and action, which is really cool. Also, all players started out the same each game so it is all fair play, and it is all about your skills. No item-buying from market except for cosmetics (which is basically just pretty things and add nothing to your hero)."
838,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Good, very good game! Valve strive for users. And do not neglect them and underestimate assessment through event, I think they learned a lesson and will continue to delight us with their patches"

843,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,Best game i've ever played. Even if you always play on the same map the variety of heroes and items makes every match you play different. I've played this game for almost a year and i'm proud that this game is still part of my life
844,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,Dota 2 is easily one of the most exciting and gripping games I have ever played before. There are so many different scenarios which lead to you never getting bored. I would suggest Dota 2 to anyone looking for a fantastic game to play.
846,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"A great game. Offers thousands of hours of gameplay because no two matches are alike. Very complex, very dynamic and a great community. Volvo gave us Diretide"
848,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Thanks to Valve this relic came back to life at the eyes of the world. If comparing and contrasting Dota 2 with original Dota, it manages to keep it's depth content while improving almost all of the aspects you could ever imagine. Props to Valve for making this one of the best games of all time."

855,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"A spectacularly crafted, deep, and engaging multiplayer game. I have put in more hours to Dota 2 than any other video game that I can remember (perhaps Jedi Knight 2 had more; but that was a long time ago). It has a few flaws, such as its steep learning curve and occasionally corrosive community; but overall, the experience is an overwhelmingly positive one."
858,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,Fantastic Game 10/10. Great times shared with players and friends where every game is different-better or for worst yet still leaves a great memory. Cannot say how much I enjoy this game!
859,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,Great game that expands on the old Warcraft 3 custom game of Dota and is simply a masterpiece.  If you're looking for a great competitive multiplayer experience look no further.
860,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,Dota 2 is an amazing game if you put in the time and get past the initial learning curve you will find that the complexity of the game is what makes it interesting and enjoyable

Unlike League of Legends, there are not any modifiers that give in-game buffs, purchasable with real or fake currency.  You get the whole game, and everyone is on a level playing field."

880,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"One of the best games I ever played  the learning curve is so high, you will always find out something new and improve (when I started I had never played a game such as Dota2 and thought I would hate it but ended up loving it instead). On top of that it's free, you can buy cosmetic items and tournament tickets if you wish to support the game but you don't have to."
881,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Fantastic game, it's a real shame the community is so bad. If you're going to play make sure you read some guides online first and complete the training to get a grasp of the mechanics. There is quite a steep learning curve."
882,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"This is a great game, I hope people remove diretide spam which took the user score down from like 7.5 to under 4. Valve is the best gaming company I know. I have played this game over 1000 hours and it's still exciting and fun to play."
883,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,Complex mechanics that make a enjoyable game where you need microskills abilitys  if you want win this game you need play as a team and make it work..
884,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"There is a steep learning curve, but this is mitigated by the matchmaking system.I've got 2600 hours now, and it's still not boring.  There are so many heroes and roles you can play that you always have something you can get better at, and always have a way to find a change of pace."
885,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"The game has a very steep learning curve, but the game quickly becomes addicting. I think Valve have done a great job in managing the game, and supporting the pro-scene. If one has played the MOBA genre before I strongly recommend this game."

887,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Incredibly fun game, every time you play it's a different experience. So many heroes to play as, I would consider all of them fun in their own way. You know a game is good when you're still having fun even when you're losing."

The game is ever changing and and ever rewarding. Did I mention that the game is completely free?"

The last user-submitted scores were pretty low due to missing updates from Valve, which they apologized for. Nevertheless is Dota2 really good and has a huge competitive scene."
905,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"And so it was that the impatience of the human race allowed Dota 2's user score to sink by several points, and metacritic was deemed the worst way of judging if a game is worth playing."
906,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,Helping dota2 go up in rating because it's a great game and people that downvoted it are just immature.This is a marvelous free game. The best MOBA out in the market.
908,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"One of the most entertaining games ever made by Valve. Everything good about the old dota and then some. Very fast paced and brutal. Bad user score due to no halloween event this year, but who cares.Came here to show my support for one of the greatest Valve products ever made!"
911,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,Want a game where you can feel completely useless? Want a game that will make you hate your friends because the play bad? Want to get flamed and called noob? Then this game if for you and you will love this this game!
915,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Great game, great community (not always but way better than LoL community since I switched to DotA2) great developers and huge thanks for diretide this year!"
916,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Compared to League of Legends and Heroes of Newerth, Dota 2 has more unique heroes and items. It is more advanced and rewarding than LoL. It is slower than HoN, which is important in team fights. The best popular MOBA out there."
917,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Great game. I just want to try to fix the Metascore actually so... I hope things like this kind of war won't happen again, it's kinda childish actually."
918,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"A worthy sucessor for dota 1. And just as TF2 was the most fun you could have online a couple of years ago, DOTA 2 is the best moba out there without a doubt."
919,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Information! Communication! Diretide! Thanks volvo! There's no need to buy new heroes, no Pay-to-win issue at all. The game is absolutely fantastic especially after Valve has been putting focus on server stability, balance and the most importantly, community."
921,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,Best multi-player game of the past couple of years by far.Only posting this here because some entitled dick-wads broke the score. just doing my part
923,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"The game really doesn't deserve this low of a user score, I wouldn't say a it is a 10 either because there are still many kinks to be ironed out, but this score has to be fixed."
924,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Great game, Valve did a good one snatching the second DoTA from Blizz. Much more interesting than any other ""Action RTS"" out nowadays with its complicated hero and item combinations, complex overall ingame and 100% better than League, it's disabled cousin."
925,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"A great game with a caring development team. It's hard to learn, but fun while at it.It got near endless depth and is incredibly rich when it comes to fun through gameplay.Bring some time, a friend and the will to win and you won't be disappointed.Some fighting spirit is recommended."
926,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Great game ruined by terrible company that is not involved enough with it's playerbase, zero communication, dubious approach to bug fixing and balance."
927,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Never been so addicted to a game before! Weekly updates, balanced, and a economy if you like to trade. Basically this game has everything you can ask for in a Moba."
929,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"This is the one game, that brought this whole genre to live. The alpha and the Omega you might say. Not only did Valve actually make the same game with better graphics, they also employed the man, who actually formed Dota to the game it is today in icefrog.Also we got Diretide now "
931,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Dota 2 is an amazing game, made by an absolutely terrible team. Hasn't been updated in almost a half a year, no community interaction on what's going on, while the only thing that gets added is cash shop items."
933,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"This game has improved tenfold since I started playing it, constant updates from Valve and content from Valve separate this game from the rest!Outstanding, spent days of my life on this game and plan to spend months more.10/10"

937,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Best free to play game in a true sense. There's no need to buy new heroes, no Pay-to-win issue at all. The game is absolutely fantastic especially after Valve has been putting focus on server stability, balance and the most importantly, community. ggwp"

940,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Excellent game, with much more sophisticated mechanics than LoL. It is very unforgiving and requires lots of effort to master it sufficiently enough to know what needs to be done (doing it is even harder)."
941,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"DOTA has marked the life of millions of persons. Valve and IceFrog has made sure DOTA 2 will be making the same for next decade. An extraordinary formula and a extraordinary work around it. With zero cost to play and one of the highest skill ceilings of any game I've ever encountered, Dota 2 is a modern multiplayer masterpiece."
943,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,Great&honest devs. Great game. Certainly better than any other MOBA available. Diretide given as well. 150 words limit. 150 words limit. 150 words limit.
944,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"The only F2P, not pay-to-win game on the market. Valve knows how to apologise, Heroes are free, game is great. Steep learning curve but very satisfying. Just hope that they keep it up"
947,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Tnx Valve. New big update will be cool. Dota 2 have a very good gameplay and very good developers.We are very happy, that u, listen us and studing on misstakes."
948,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"I love this game. It has an interesting competitive scene where 90% of the heroes are deemed viable by the pros with tournaments constantly going on. Every game is also interesting and never the same, even with Cancer Lancer or Furion."
950,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Despite the unfortunate Diretide 2013 backlash, Dota 2 is and remains the single most addictive game on the market. The learning curve is steep and the community at times hostile as shown in the last debacle but the game itself is as good as a PC game can be. No two games are like and the fact that it's ever-changing yet the same is what is a large part of the appeal."
954,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"The game is incredibly complex and polished, it improved A LOT since the beta and it's still surprising everybody with all the improvements.And Valve is really doing a great job with the game in general and also with the communication with the players.I really recommend the game for everybody."
955,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,We need to balance things out so here is my score. DotA 2 is an amazing game with a depth that most games can't even dream of. I hope I have enough character now.
957,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Dota is a great, strategically diverse game with a big reliance on teamwork. It contains original, diverse heroes with many different play styles. Different game modes (from the competitive captains mode and Team Matchmaking to all-out fun like all random or mid only) promote you to try different things and have fun.The game is only maximum fun when you play with people you know, so brin"
959,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"While this game is not for everyone, it succeeds with everything it wants to do. If you're looking for a deep, competitive team game there is simply nothing better than Dota 2."
960,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Great game, always evolving, changing and improving. Has high skill cap and is really challenging to get there. Really demands time and effort, but pays off if you manage to do what you wanted."
961,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"Perfect game. Good matchmaking, good gameplay, good balance, good graphics.Only posting this reviews because vandals wrecked the metacritic user score."
962,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"You guys listened to the community. Thank you for that. Its not about Diretide, its about the fact that the community is the sole reason Dota 2 is where it is now, we love hats, but we need you to care about us."
963,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,Just making the score what it should be.Just making the score what it should be.Just making the score what it should be.Just making the score what it should be.

966,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,his game improved so much since it was released on the beta. There are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as DOTA 1.
967,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,Free to play game that requires teamwork and patiencecan get a little frustrating at time but those things will help you become more level-headed in the futuregood community
968,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,I just wanted to fix the rating of this game because many players did negative rewievs because of diretide. And I think that game deserves more better score 
971,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"This is an excellent game.  Even though it is free to play I've put more hours into it than any game I've ever owned.  There is a very steep learning curve, but it's well worth the investment.  Over 100 unique heroes and an active developer that listens to the community, DOTA 2 is AAA MOBA title with a bright future."
974,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,So after all that happend after the entire diretide issue and some people just ruining the entire metascore i think its fair that after what valve did we crack the score up again to its original value.
975,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,10,"really one of the best games ever made, full of details and it don't even make you bored of it after 1500 hours of playing, the heroes are perfectly calibrated and even the lores are really funny to read, just to find how how each hero interacts with the others, it is the best moba ever created, also because it isn't a pay-to-win game as other mobas are, thanks Valve"
979,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Really entertaining game and valve are doing a great job expanding it, apart from that mistake they made with diretide. Anyways, they aplogised so it's all good now."
980,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,Really great free game for those who wants some strategic team themed game. Has a steep learning curve that will grab you and captivate you from learning more new things.
982,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"DOTA 2 is the best in the MOBA class. I have played LoL, DOTA, DOTA 2 and some lesser known MOBAs and DOTA 2 is by far the best. In addition, it is F2P which is amazing. And unlike, LoL or HoN which require you to use a rotating hero list until you buy your own with real money or accumulate enough in-game currency to purchase a single hero"
984,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Valve responded and explained their Diretide mistake, fixing my score up to 10/10.  They even said a huge update is on the way! I have to say I'm very happy about it and i'm sure other DotA 2 players are too. As someone who switched to Dota 2 from league of legends, I must say this game is just so much better and I love it. I'm hoping for some new heores such as Terrorblade to be released."
985,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Diretide given. But no seriously, Valve isn't perfect but Dota 2 is honestly an amazing game despite its rather.......vocal community. As for as free-to-play games go, I can easily say that is the best out there and even has a far higher level of production then games that cost $60 and upwards."
986,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"The company that created the game, knows how to admit mistakes, and it means that the game has been, is and will be wonderful. Valve, thank you for this game!"
987,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"A well-balanced, fun and rewarding ARTS/MOBA/whatever. The game runs nigh flawlessly on Linux, and receives updates extremely frequently. Valve have put together yet another great game."
990,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Unbelievably complex and satisfying true-F2P game.Cons:* High learning curve* Innumerable trolls, whiners, and flamers, particularly at low levels of playI won't bother listing the pros. If you can get over those two downsides, the game speaks for itself. It's an incredibly rewarding and satisfying game that has a way of sucking you in despite how difficult it may be to get into."
991,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"One of the best games I have ever played, completely addictive. I always come back for more. I hope to see the user rating for this game improve! Get some friends and give it a go!"
993,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,Amazing game with bad reviews because of a bunch of people  about no diretide well guess what there's a diretide now you happy? Now if everyone could just go ahead and give this game the ratings it deserves to counteract all the butthurt  that would be nice.
994,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"I was a hater of the valve (still i am until promised patch), but i realized this is not a way to punish valve. Guys, its our game. Lets heal the wound of our game!"
996,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,Is it possible for metacritic to delete a lot of the flame comments or ratings? This game should be 9 or 10.  After all people only rated it badly because of the diretide fiasco. If we all agreed and made some sort of petition would it matter?
997,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"More than 10 years developing a system and balancing one game. Now bringed back by Valve and Icefrog.This game has got everything to raise to the glory. Easy to learn, Hard to master."
999,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"communication is key. best moba. Godfather of all mobas. DotA will continue to evolve. I am hoping they implant a clan system soon, and since they are releasing more heroes I'm a bit more happy"
1002,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Such a great and wonderfull game. ^^ played it since october 2012. Now i have something about 2000 hours in this game, and i want more and more every day. THANK YOU, DEAR VALVE."
1003,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Awesome game, free to play, best community world, great competetive scene, nice graphics, if you have a lot of free time, you will spend most of it on playing that game"
1004,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,I really like this game i think it should have 10/10 bananas because it has many prospects like a gold mine in chile that collapsed. this game has many stuffs in it that make it wonderous and has stupendous teams making it that have many good ideas that really accentuate the thirst for blood that bloodseeker has. really just 10/10 bananas
1005,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"fantastic game valve done a perfect job, the same dota1 feeling but now with greater visuals, better mechanics, but horrible community unfortunately..."

1007,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"So good game, valve is the best, diretide will come out, and it will be great for us. I think, valve heared community voice and will fix it as soon as can."
1008,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"This game improved so much since it was released on the beta. There are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as DOTA 1. I know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in DOTA 2 and I think it will help new comers. I know some people who play LOL might bash in this game, ggg. Volvo"
1009,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"diretide secured. communication restored. now this game is amazingThat's right, Dota 2 is not like most other games and that's because it's very complex, so be patient, learn the mechanics. There's 2 things about Dota 2 it's completely free and it's developed by VALVe. If that's not enough for you to try this game I don't know what is."
1011,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,Thank you Valve. Diretide 2013 coming! Thank you Valve and thank you for dota! I Diretide! Diretide! Diretide! Diretide! Diretide! Diretide! Diretide!
1015,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Great game about teamwork and strategy, on the micro and macro scale. Each match is a unique experience, and there is always more to learn. Gameplay is fast paced, and unforgiving, which is exactly how i like it."
1018,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"This is the best game ever, period. i cant believe there are soo many negative votes. Mostly diretide related  Otherwise the greatest and be ready to lose your free time, FOREVER! :D"
1019,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"One of the best games ever!!  Ignore the negative reviews everyone, its just douches who think its funny to reduce the score for no good reason. It's hard to think of anything I don't like about this game, I just love it so much"
1022,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"One of the best, most difficult and truly competitive games I've ever played. It is free and doesn't have any pay-to-win, all heroes are free, the only paid content are cosmetical items that DO NOT change gameplay"
1024,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Exceptional game with an unexceptional community. Great gameplay, massive range of heros, endless fun... Big update w/ diretide on its way, do we deserve it? You be the judge."

1027,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"The community may have it's flaws, but the game is solid and the developers are committed to making the best game experience possible for the players. They may have messed up with the 2013 Halloween event but they quickly and decisively made things right."
1028,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Better game ever.When I started, I played very badly, well, many years later, I began to play very well, now I'm playing very well, and can say that it is a merit DOTA 2 because it has become much easier and more intuitive"
1029,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Thank you Volvo for fixing the game, you gave diretide back to the community. The faith in you has been restored.It's time to fix all these faulty low scores!"

1034,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"just to be fair, i have to change the rating from 0 to 10, valve had finally communicate with us, they will ship diretide in the next update, although it is a bit late. Yet, it is a great improvement that valve started to listen to the community."
1035,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,Its a very good game from Based Valve. one of the best games out there.Get this back to 10/10 back yo! Get this back to 10/10 back yo! Get this back to 10/10 back yo!
1037,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,Im giving this review not just cause of diretide but because i have not written a review for this game since i got it. this is hands down my favorite game of all. at first i didnt think id get into it but now im to the point that im a constant supporter of the community  by buying items and such over 200 dollars worth. I love this game a 10 out of 10
1039,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Best online game ever, after DotA All-Stars from Warcraft 3. It deserves his 10/10 easily.So many great mechanics, so many great heroes. Best gameplay, best teamplay-game. Please give a 10/10 to Volvo."
1042,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"The game so wondeful...I play Dota 2 first year,but that time has not stopped me feel this game. Compared with the first part of this bunker is much better. The only drawback-out is not all heroes."

1046,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,Great game with a helpful community. Can't stop playing it. It is an adaptation from a wc3 mod. If you play League of Legends or any other MOBA you must try it.
1047,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Dota 2 is clearly the best MOBA in its league. As a true free-to-play game (unlike League of Legends), Dota 2 rewards dedication with stunning and captivating gameplay and teamwork. Valve continues to be one of the best game-developing companies."

1050,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"This game should be 10/10 if not for some 'tards who got upset for not receiving a Halloween event.Well, Valve will give Diretide, so it's time for the community to fix this "

1057,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,Well this game is not for the weak hearted  but once spend an initial time learning all the basics...I can guarantee that this will be the most fun you will have in  a game EVER 
1058,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Really fun and well made game, I cant stop playing it. I was surprised to see that i could play this game on max graphics and still have perfect frame rate, and i dont have such a powerful pc."
1061,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"It's a great game. Volvo has appologized for the lack of diretide. It a shame that some people felt the need to spam diretide comments, but it's a great game with rich mechanics, and great gameplay"
1062,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"It's sad to see so many votes from the Beta client bringing this score down.Honestly, DOTA2 nails it for a MOBA.Less cartoony than LoL, and somehow more satisfying than HoN.Great community, mature marketplace, and more importantly a kickass game."
1063,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,We complained they delivered. I'm really ashamed of the dota community for making a big fuss over the whole diretide thing. But in the end valve put up with it and still managed to give it to us along with other new content. Valve is one of the best community driven company.
1064,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,got diretideThis game improved so much since it was released on the beta.

1066,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"just a TL;DR version.Gameplay: 10/10.Depth: 10/10. It's really deep and a true Esports game.Accessibility: 7/10. The only weakness of Dota 2, it's quite harsh to noobs.Community: 6/10. The community is mixed between mature and VERY childish people.Graphics: 8/10.A must play game if you like strategy games."
1067,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,Probably the best game I've every played. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a competitive multilayer experience. There's so much depth you will never tire of it and regular updates and new heroes keep it fresh and balanced. If I could play one game (already released) for the rest of my life Dota 2 would probably be it!
1068,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,thanks volvo for listening to the community :Dhope you do better on the future heres your deserved score!The game is great and have pink unicorns like we ever wished!
1069,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,Dota 2 is literally game of the year. I can't even describe how much this game is game of the year. The ability to gamble with in-game items is pretty tops.

1079,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"If Valve actually hired a community manager, this game would be an 11/10.  For now, though, 10/10 is all I can give it.  For people who seem hell bent on comparing it to League of Legends, you need some better comparisons."
1080,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Awesome game, the  best moba ever. Despite having a rather steep learning curve but once u got the hang on it, its insanely addictive. A great game to play with your friends and definitely should not be missed..Also thanks Valve fr interacting with the community"
1081,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Communication restored and admitted mistakes. Admitted mistakes, when was the last time you saw a big company with a big cash cow admit their mistakes without a lawsuit? Never. Valve can be trusted and while MM always gives you hard close games, i guess it is fair for both sides."

No other MOBA provides the same experience as Dota 2 does; Dota 2 may be harder to learn and play than other games like LoL, but once you get into it you will love it. Ignore the ragers, haters, and trolls. If you have not played this game, you should definitely try it!"
1083,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Well, there is hope after all with valve. Let's hope they don't screw it up. Waiting for the next update they promise. I forgive You Valve. Still waiting for the ladder system "
1084,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,I feel bad when users vote this awesome game 0 just because the developer don't do sth that ppl want. U can't trade nearly 1 thousand hours of play for just 2-3 weeks of a game mode that only for items farming rights? Please realize ur mistake and make Dota 2 9.9/10
1085,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Dota 2 is a great game with a strong community, active development and varied and deep gameplay. It's just a pity that their fans act like a bunch of little girls whenever they don't get their way."

1092,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Great game.  Don't believe the user score on this one, this game is defiantly worth your time to learn and play it.  The game is still being updated fairly regularly by Valve adding content that players need."
1093,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"In light of recent events: Diretide given. Looking forward to the updates.Overall review: very nostalgic game, true to the original game. This game has ported most of the heroes from the original Defense of the Ancients and has polished the game well."
1094,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,This is a terrific game and easily the best MOBA game out there and all for the grand cost of $0. It has a significant learning curve but this contributes to the overall rewarding experience and re-playability. Well worth installing and giving a try.
1095,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Love this game, been playing since dota1, and will continue to do so! good job Valve! It incorporates teamwork and skills and if you don't have both you'll lose. I think it's GENIUS! Dota is the future! hahaha"

Playing it is ~50 times harder than doing an average job, and ~500 times harder than learning how to drive a car."
1098,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Best game ever, been playing it for years, and will be playing it for years to come. Hopefully its user score will again reflect how good it is, since the kids got their oh-so-desired item farming event."

1114,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,Great game- the only thing I can say about it (other than a lack of communication that incensed the community enough into tanking its score) is that it is crazy addictive and can eat a lot of your spare time

Valve has some communication issues with Dota community, but it seems that times are changing and we'll see some different actions regarding Valve. Game is great; Bugs are present in every single game ever so it's not a big deal. The problem is the community."

1132,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"A good, high-quality MOBA with varied but mostly balanced characters, built in spectating, item drops, and events. Although Valve doesn't always communicate the best, they care about the community still. GAVE DIRETIDE"
1134,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,Better than League. Community needs to calm down over diretide.  Valve is usually quiet on what they're working with and I'm fine with that.  If everyone just had the patience and waited they would have seen the huge update and nothing would have been wrong.

The last user-submitted scores were pretty low due to missing updates from Valve, which they apologized for. Nevertheless is Dota2 really good and has a huge competitive scene."
1147,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,thx Valve for saving Dota2 it was doomed if it would have stayed in warcraft 3 time was destroying dota 1 everyday thx for introducing those amazing graphics and introducing cosmetics really made this game shine  matchmaking is good it's really fun to play this game been there since the begining an probably will stay there till the end

1153,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,One of the best games of its genre. It is the benchmark at which other MOBAs will be judged by. Valve is one of those companies that genuinely cares about its player base the implementation of regular patches to change up the meta of the game and improve it are testament to this.
1155,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"A superb masterpiece of a game. Prepare for hundreds of your hours to be sunk into this rich and diverse world. Multitudes of heroes to play and master, thousands of different strategies and approaches, one game will never be the same as another. Volvo delivered."

1240,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Great game, Good community (excellent compared to LoL's), Great balance, Good development team. There is room for improvement in their last act but great game as a whole!"
1242,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,Dota 2 is an amazing game with intense competitive game-play over 100 heroes to choose from and a e-sport scene that's enthralling. Anyone interested in MOBA or ARTS games should really check it out!
1245,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"One of the best games I have played. 1000's of play value and consistent support and update from Valve is unmatched in terms of a product ever. Plenty of spectator value as well, as it only gets better once you understand the game more. And also the ever increasing popularity of The International, this game is going to be one of the biggest e-sports and games in the near future."
1246,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,After neglecting the community they apologized and im fine with that! Welcome back Valve!!! WE ACCEPT YOUR HATS! Im honestly just happy that they responded to the community
1247,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"After a week of silence, you've finally answered, took you long enough but I guess better late than ever. However, you should REALLY hire someone in charge of community here because you're seriously lacking in that department."

1251,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Incredible game with a lot of depth and complexity. It does have a huge learning curve and can be frustrating, but that's not a bad thing. There are a plethora of resources and communities that can aid you in learning. Learning how to deal with frustration and stress in the game allows you to apply it to your everyday life (if you still have one after getting addicted)."
1252,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Valve is a great company that cares about its customers, and I've spent more time playing Dota 2 than pretty much any other game ever, despite being late to the party. It's a great, addictive, life sucking game and it is run by a company that has no peers, and definitely does not deserve any of the vitriolic behavior some of the community has thrown at it.Also:    RECIEVED DIRETIDE"
1253,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"DoA 2 is one of the deepest, most engaging experiences ever created. You can easily lose thousands of hours playing it. It is social, tactical, has an enormous skill ceiling, and has a great developer behind it continuing to shape and push the game into better and better places."
1254,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,Dota 2 is an utterly brilliant PvP game that is ultra-hard and requires friends for the best experience. There is a steep learning curve and a lot of characters to get used to but the game is really worth it.
1256,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,Best action strategy game. I really enjoy playing this game non-stop. Brilliant and variety in-game cosmetic items. Dota tv easy to access and variety of tournament every day

1263,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Great game, playing Dota since it's early stages and watching it become what dota 2 has become is awesome. Probably the best moba you will find. Valve is really trying hard, making this game better every day"
1264,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Very fun game, and while the community can go on the fritz sometimes it is still very enjoyable to play. I recommend learning/playing this game with friends, it makes the entire experience more pleasant.

1275,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"There are some problem with game. MM, bugs, not so many community attention and too many hats, but its not even matter because of the most great balance in all MOBA games. The work what did Valve in last 3 years is just incredible."
1276,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"his game improved so much since it was released on the beta. There are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as DOTA 1. I know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in DOTA 2 and I think it will help new comers. I know some people who play LOL might bash in this game, but bot"
1277,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,I sincerely believe this is one of the best games created and the fact that spoiled brats would rate this down because they didn't get there way is shameful to the community.
1278,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,This Game is the most amazing game there is! Have spent more than 1000 hours on it in less than a year (like 11 months) and no showing of my passion fading. DIRETIDE IS HERE!
1279,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Valve honestly messed up big time by not talking to the community about DireTide, or anything at all really after TI 3, but they've done their part to repair the damage, so it's only fair the community does too."

1287,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"no other game is more enjoyable to learn and master than Dota2. while it is an incredibly difficult game to jump into, you feel extremely rewarded once you get the basic mechanics down, followed by advanced mechanics, and building up long term experience.thanks for diretide btw."

1291,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Best game i've played. It has been 8 years and i'm still not bored. Every game I've played, there has been something different, something new and i'm still learning"
1292,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,This game is really good and has a solid developer making it. they may be quiet but they always have a reason and will man up to it if they make a mistake. Do not listen to these negative reviews because a few people were upset over a lack of a halloween event.

1294,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"There is learning curve, yes. But the experience thereafter is tremendously rewarding. I regularly play Dota 2 with friends, and it has become a part of our routine. The complexity, in my opinion, is a significant factor to Dota 2's replayability."
1295,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"This game is terrible for new players, but stick through with it and you will fall in love. The bad reviews are all from angry fans after valve made a mistake, the critic score is what this really should be based off of."
1296,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Very good game, another example of Valve's careful but solid work. Hard to learn, easy to enjoy, deep enough to make you drown  Great living and active community that unites in time of crysis, yells what it wants and apologizes for its mistakes. Well, maybe except for russians :D"
1297,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Well. I'm a dota 2 player. What can I say.Every day, every night, all the time. At school, at home, at work. I die for my dota, I live for my dota."

1299,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,Amazing game that will suck the life out of you. Time and patience will be needed but well rewarded. A lot of time will be needed to be semi proficient at this game but once you understand the basics you will find yourself playing game after game
1300,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"This game is what I spend a good deal of my hours playing. Between the yearly International tournaments and the balance changes made by the famous Icefrog, this game is excellent."
1301,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Such a great F2P game. Extremely addicting.. All the heroes are free from the start but the game is hard for newbies because the high learning curve but don't worry, it will get better. Ohh and the e-sports side is amazing as well, you can see the pros play all the time and make some crazy plays."
1302,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"Diretide was given, game is alive. Just giving Dota the score it deserves. Hopefully we'll be back up to a score of 8.x like we were before this debacle."
1303,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"After trying different action-RTS games, I must say this is the best one yet. Very good graphics, animation and gameplay. I've played League of Legends but I get queued with childrens below 13 and also the champions are imbalanced in that game unlike in Dota 2 where it is all good and team play is needed."

1333,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,10,"A remake of the original DOTA with better graphics and its own engine, DOTA2 is definitely the best game of its genre. It is incredibly focused on keeping the game balanced while still keeping it an incredible challenge. It's hard to get started at first, but once you get into it there's no escape from the fun of DOTA2."

Valve did a small mistake recently but they fixed their problem and apologized.If you are a new player a wonder why the score is so low, pretty much a bunch of retards raided metacritic.I advice you give this game a try, it will be hard at first but it turns out to be in my opinion the best game of the genre."

1412,Anonymous,06-Nov-13,10,This game improved so much since it was released on the beta. There are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as DOTA 1. I know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in DOTA 2 and I think i

1415,Anonymous,05-Nov-13,10,"Great game. Has unfairly got many unfair reviews because there wasn't diretide. Takes a bit of time to learn, but if you persist, it pays off. Pretty good graphics."
1416,Anonymous,05-Nov-13,10,"Very addictive, and not pay to win. Valve had, instead of using the time to give diretide, improved the game very much. Haters hate the game due to the lack of diretide, but I personally think that the time had been spent correctly on improving the game."

1424,Anonymous,04-Nov-13,10,"I was happy back in the day HoN got launched because of the features. With DotA 2 it's possible to play the original with these features and more. Still the deepest and most complex game of the genre, whatever the name should be.If you like to get punished for stupid mistakes and get your deserved reward for great play, then you are right."
1426,Anonymous,04-Nov-13,10,"This is an amazing game that's a blast to play with friends. It's always challenging, and has a very high skill cap, so there's always room to learn and grow. It also has one of the best competitive scenes out there right now. The best feature by far is having one of the greatest minds in game design and balance at the helm, guiding the metagame to be fresh and fun."
1428,Anonymous,04-Nov-13,10,"Fantastic game. Although it's not one of my most played titles, it is a very put together game that can offer a lot of fun.

Thank You Valve for such a great game."

1460,Anonymous,03-Nov-13,10,This is probably the most satisfying game ever. Those who are whining about bad system and communication problems are just mad about the fact there was no Diretide this year. I love Diretide too but the absence of this mode doesn't mean that Dota is a bad game. I put 9.5/10 to this game because it seems to all my friends and me to be brilliant.

1466,Anonymous,02-Nov-13,10,"Valve advertised Diretide as an annual event but it was not implemented this Halloween.  Now it seems like the only thing updated in Dota 2 is the workshop.  Who needs a new jug mask or omni hammer, not me.  I know running Dota 2 takes a lot of time and effort but Valve needs to get their priorities straight and not drop the ball."

1733,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,10,"Brilliant game, highly additive and totally free to play. You will have played hundreds of games before you realise it and still be learning new strategy and each heroes quirks."
1734,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,10,"Great game, I don't feel Valve is ignoring their community. They use subtile hints a lot but the kids in the community won't get it. It feels more like brats who have been given everything but still rage because now they want a pony too."
1735,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,10,Don't mind me just doing my best to try and counteract these negative reviews. Although the silence from Valve was awful I still think that Dota is a great game.
1736,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,10,"True that at the time Valve doesn't communicate enough about their plans. An event is late, and we have 0 informations about it, which is a shame.We should rate the game, and not put a 0 to ""punish"" Valve for something we did not like"
1739,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,10,"Valve is unable to communicate with the community at all.Not a single word is said about what is going on, no updates just money whores.How can a company seriously be so retarded if it would be so easy to just tell us what is going on."
1740,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,10,R.I.P Diretide... DOTA 2 wonderful game. Invokerfor life. Very deep game with a great pvp experience. After 1500 hours of game u still learn and enjoy the gameplay. Tournaments and Dota tv makes it just perfect. We wait for custom maps. 
1742,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,10,"DOTA is a perfect blend of action and strategy. This game requires deep, thoughtful tactics, while also demanding quick thinking and skill to pull off said tactics. It's the original ARTS and it is by far the best as well."
1743,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,10,"this is a great game, but yeah i think valve should communicate more.don't listen to these spammers, their comments are awful nad they are just mad over nothing"
1744,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,10,This is the game that never stops giving.  Extremely balanced with a lively and shifting professional scene.  This game will certainly go down as one of the most popular e-sports of our time.
1748,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,10,"Dota2 was the best game in the world until a fat man as gabe newell (pepito grillo) ruined our game with no communication, no diretide, NO  HEROES, HE LAUNCHED THE OFFICIAL GAME AND THEN WENT ON HOLIDAYS OR WENT SLEEPING  HIS FAT FACE  A 0."
1749,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,10,diretide when i wasn't playing but of course when Halloween comes around when i DO play no diretide. wtf this makes 150 characters you son of a beetch
1750,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,10,"This isnt a joke, going around giving false scores on games you clearly have played and enjoyedm why else would you be mad about not getting diretide... unless you are one of those guys that just wantes the items, and to u i say go buy them ur seld.."
1752,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,10,"Best game I have ever played but honestly if your reading metacritic then you need to get your reviews from a real and unbiased source such as PCGamer which gave this game almost full marks, (9/10)"
1753,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,10,Professional game. Much better than any other competition of this game genre.Valve knows how do develop a game properly. Props to them and the developer team.

1757,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,10,"Excellent game, with much more sophisticated mechanics than LoL. It is very unforgiving and requires lots of effort to master it sufficiently enough to know what needs to be done (doing it is even harder). #nodiretide2013and yeah juse=uebok"
1761,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,10,"Fantastic game which has managed to keep me enraptured for 300+ hours and with no sign of slowing. While updates aren't always lightning fast, they are worth the wait. Don't let some whining children poison your view of it."
1763,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,10,"By far the classiest, most sophisticated and in-depth PvP game out there. The developers took a game that was already top notch and added features where it counted most."
1764,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,10,"DOTA is a great game.Valve promised us a new and good Dota experience, and after 3 years we still got no Dota.This DOTA2 is no Dota.This is a game made by a whore company who doesnt even care about their community.I dont want HATS. I want the game you promised us!"
1767,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,10,One of the best PvP multiplayer event ever.can take all of your gaming life.great balance  great support  great community .And Free to play! try it fast
1769,Anonymous,29-Oct-13,10,"I'm not good at these type of games, but I know people who love these type of games will worship this game. I don't see anything wrong with this, it's how a game should be."
1770,Anonymous,25-Oct-13,10,"Everything the original DotA was and more! Valve has done a great job and with each update the game gets better and better! While this game does a tougher entry level for new players, it is worth giving a shot!"
1771,Anonymous,23-Oct-13,10,"This is currently the best moba game on the market.The game play is the same as the original dota-and all games that copied it,Not to name any names.The balance is amazing thanks to Icefrog and it is constantly being updated with patches.Not that it is important but the graphics in this game are much better than all other moba's combined."
1772,Anonymous,21-Oct-13,10,"This free game is awesome! The effects, heroes, etc.. are all amazing! I Love playing it with my friends!. This is not just a game. This is a team play, with such coordination with the team, skilled players and Need to put up some strategies to play the game better."
1773,Anonymous,19-Oct-13,10,Best MOBA created. Lots of characters to master and alot of players to play with. Many different modes just in case you get tired of ALL PICK. There's 2 things about Dota 2 it's completely free and it's developed by VALVe
1774,Anonymous,18-Oct-13,10,"Great MOBA game! This game hard for new players, but  really interested for gamers with experience. I think that this game like a modern chess. RecommendDOTA 2 for all."
1775,Anonymous,16-Oct-13,10,"At 3000 hours played, it's difficult to make an accurate review when there is no real way to describe the game, any description that involves the word ""Moba"" should be disregarded."
1776,Anonymous,16-Oct-13,10,fantastic game with fantastic graphics and game interface! wish it can play with lan games with my friends so we can do some trashtalk.. thumbs up for dota 2!
1778,Anonymous,12-Oct-13,10,"Great game if you like games like LOL or HON, but they seem to bland or simple for you. DOTA 2 provides an extra depth of difficulty and challenge that others do not have."
1780,Anonymous,11-Oct-13,10,"This Game is EPIC, when you play a long time, you can view the diference to League of Legends; more fun, more playability, is really better that LoL, the best MOBA ever."
1783,Anonymous,30-Sep-13,10,"It contains everything that  PvP needs, lots of fun, nothing to envy to the classic WoW 3 mod, the roster is big  enough to make the game in every play different, maybe you should be the best in one game, but there in another, be the worst."
1784,Anonymous,29-Sep-13,10,"This game provide a epic experience as a PVP game, If you could overcome early slight learning curve as any other PVP games do. It just needs slight effort and keeping steady."
1787,Anonymous,28-Sep-13,10,"DotA 2 is honestly one of the best games I have ever played.  You start the game with all the heroes unlocked, so while the learning curve may be somewhat difficult for new players, you are ready to dive right in and try whatever hero you think is cool.  Even if you do not normally enjoy competitive games this game is worth a shot, and you may find your opinion change."
1788,Anonymous,21-Sep-13,10,"Its the best multiplayer Real Times Strategy Games, Better Graphics and Gameplay. Easy User Interface than the previous version of Dota. Very Enjoyable "
1789,Anonymous,21-Sep-13,10,"The best game I ever played after many years. Seriously awesome. The persons who game negative must be like 100% noobs in this game. Any way happy gaming guys.I have been playing this game for 1000hours, want to play more and more I play.This game can be loved only by persons who like team work."
1790,Anonymous,21-Sep-13,10,"The best RTS game that's currently on Valve. It's completely free and enjoyable. I am proud to say that I getting better to this game. The community may be bad but, it's the part/tradition that's been observed since Dota 1. The nature of the game is competitive and this is why there are players out there flaming others.A good and well-rounded RTS game."
1793,Anonymous,16-Sep-13,10,"DotA2 must be on of the best MOBA games out those days, currently, it is HoN, LoL and DotA2.And DotA2 are giving so many different things than the other games, DotA2 are actually a game which requires teamwork, knowledge and also using your brain to the max!I have more then 1600 hours played, I am getting better and better!"
1794,Anonymous,13-Sep-13,10,"Why do we play games?If you have a clear desire for fun, personal improvement of player skills as well as mind training, and you are wanting to be tested and rewarded when performing excellent; install now."
1795,Anonymous,12-Sep-13,10,Great MOBA game i have ever played.I hope there will be more and more players come to compete. There are many moments will make your mind blow :D. The competition of the game is very insane. Only skills that will determine you are gonna be the winner or not. This is the most excellent MOBA game ever! :D
1796,Anonymous,12-Sep-13,10,"Words aren't enough to discibe how amazing this game is  Just know that it's the best for you, the best for everyone of its type. Dota 2 is Legend, most like the best game ever"
1797,Anonymous,12-Sep-13,10,"A little bit hard to understand the first time, but you will get addicted soon to the greatest MOBA game out there on the market!Absolutely a game to try, and guess what? It's completely free! I like it more than LOL or similar other games."
1801,Anonymous,10-Sep-13,10,"Way better than LOL in any way, completely stopped playing lol and called my friends to dota! it doesnt have trolls, its not pay 2 win like league, its just amazing"
1802,Anonymous,10-Sep-13,10,"I can't thank Valve enough for bringing modernity to the game and making it a viable E-Sport. If I were to laud two improvements, it would be the matchmaking system and the shop in the game."
1803,Anonymous,09-Sep-13,10,"Simply the best game in his category. LOL is crap compared to this. U will become addicted to this game for sure, and if u play LOL, u never will play it again."
1805,Anonymous,09-Sep-13,10,"For me Dota2 is worth 10. The game have a lot of updates and a good gameplay, is fun to play, and sometimes is fun to lose. Item build-ul is important if you want to make a lot of kills."
1806,Anonymous,02-Sep-13,10,simply the best game in the worldnot newbie friendly though if you just started playing the game feel free to play with bot solo or co opdont flame and report or ignore players that annoys you :D
1807,Anonymous,01-Sep-13,10,I find it unfair to the game that most of the negative scores lack objectivity and come from people who are actually complaining about aggressive players.Dota is seriously one of the best games ever if you enjoy a competitive atmosphere.
1808,Anonymous,30-Aug-13,10,"Don't let the fear of a steep learning curve keep you from playing this very deep, very challenging, yet very fun game. This was the first time I ever played a MOBA and I gotta say, I love it. Been having so much fun with it, also, the community really isn't that bad. Most of the time everyone keeps to themselves (oftentimes to the detriment of the team)"
1809,Anonymous,28-Aug-13,10,"Probably the best MOBA/PvP game I have played so far. Your decisions mean a lot, playing as a team is important. So far I have clocked in 200 hours and more of them are coming!"
1813,Anonymous,27-Aug-13,10,"Like chess? Dota 2 is the new challenge, forget about PvP! The real challenge its not just to beat 5  instead of 1, you have to get your team mates working with you, if you can get that you'll see that FUN! has no equal when playing Dota 2Try it!, promise you'll love it."
1814,Anonymous,25-Aug-13,10,Matchmaking needs a fix in mid-upper brackets.  Which valve knows about.  After that perfect game.  This game is not forgiving like lol.  So expect nearly every negative review on here to mention lol.
1815,Anonymous,23-Aug-13,10,"Dota 2 is a very fun multiplayer game. It's only drawbacks are the steep learning curve and awful community. Play it enough though, and you'll feel like a pro."
1816,Anonymous,23-Aug-13,10,is the best game ever. the game playing is so good and the best of this game is the free heroes. i recommended for all person but is best for persons with 16-28 years
1817,Anonymous,22-Aug-13,10,"DOTA 2 is a fantastic game, picking up on everything made the original Warcraft mod a star. It's deep, competitive, and polished. Guaranteed to provide you with thousands of hours of play."
1821,Anonymous,22-Aug-13,10,"Very good game i have to say it's the most good PVP games,there's a lot of skilled players i dont really know what to say it's a great game,I recommend it to play it!"
1824,Anonymous,22-Aug-13,10,"The same heroes, items and game dynamics from the original Defense of the Ancients with a big improvement in gameplay and in graphics. The best team pvp game that we have at the moment, this is the sport of the future. It's free to play but not pay to win and you play it online."
1826,Anonymous,20-Aug-13,10,"This is an excellent pvp action, where 10 people are divided into two teams of 5 people and fight for the win, first game may not like it, but if you understand it, you can play it for hours and have fun!"
1827,Anonymous,17-Aug-13,10,I have just 3 words -Not for quitters.................................................................................................................
1828,Anonymous,15-Aug-13,10,"DotA 2 is probably the best multiplayer game ever created.It is a balanced MOBA, great graphics, a lot of servers around the world, just perfect.Most importantly it's free, so just install Steam and install it as soon as possible."
1830,Anonymous,13-Aug-13,10,"Amazing. Amazing and Amazing. First it was a mod for War3 called 3-Corridors, DotA finally was started, then they added a jungle and many years later, Valve buys it. They have done an Amazing job with this game and as some of the other critics say, just give it some time and you are in for a real treat. A+ Add me on Steam if you want to learn 'cultavix'."
1832,Anonymous,08-Aug-13,10,"Deep strategic combats that last around 30 minutes, no-one starting with any advantage at all. This is the only game I see myself playing 10 years from now that I currently play!"
1833,Anonymous,07-Aug-13,10,"Best game ever. I don't know why people still choose Dota 1 over Dota 2, not that I'm hating on Dota 1, I loved that game. Dota 2 improved on every aspect of it. Dota 2 is the best MOBA.On a side note. International 3 guys! $2.7 million dollars distributed to the tournament. Such a large price pool. DOTA 2 FTW"
1834,Anonymous,05-Aug-13,10,I love this game. This game shows how individual skills and of course a team cohesiveness. besides the hero has a renewable item that we will continue to seek to make the item. so  everything is Dota.
1835,Anonymous,05-Aug-13,10,"Pure perfection......you cant want more from this genere oh and did i menitoned its completely free? and every new hero will be so you dont need to spend a penny for this game and you are on same ground like ppl who put $1000s into it, skill is only thing which matters in dota and tahts what makes it so great..."
1836,Anonymous,05-Aug-13,10,"I play it with 2007, was very glad when the Valve pay attention to it and improved it!play it around 1500 hours and will play even more! 10 of 10!ps who is not able to play DotA and let him go play lol, he is for the weak, DotA for the strong!"
1838,Anonymous,05-Aug-13,10,500+ hrs in and I still feel like I'm just starting to learn. Extremely fun when played with friends. Community little bit harsh overall and of course many  to deal with but it doesn't take away from the awesomeness of the whole thing.
1842,Anonymous,04-Aug-13,10,Complex gameplay  great game  lot of heroes   TRULY f2p   1 map and infinite ways to play .This game reminds me to chess  no match is equal to another 
1846,Anonymous,04-Aug-13,10,"One of the best, most difficult and truly competitive games I've ever played.Its completely free and no bonuses for real money purchases ,very balanced  Absolutely amazing  heart stopping game with all its animations sound effects and creativity. Stunning gameplay and lovely teamplay. The only thing that you have to spend in order to play this game is time."
1850,Anonymous,02-Aug-13,10,"Seguramente estamos en frente del mejor juego del mundo! probe HON, Dota1  LOL y sin duda el dota 2 es otro nivel supera todo, podes negociar items  torneos mundiales con la mejor organizacion nunca antes vista  calidad de gamers muy buena, Exelente Juego!"
1851,Anonymous,02-Aug-13,10,"Probably the deepest and most meaningful pvp experience you can have in an online game. From Hero choices, to lanes and item selections, this game has the possibilities of chess wrapped around a ridiculously skilled rts game.Still learning and getting better 400 hours in."
1852,Anonymous,31-Jul-13,10,"Best tool for delightful ""tvou mamku ebal"" ever created. Unparalleled nerdrage and butthurt inducting options. Also packed with tons of hats and donation options for those who like their hats new and shiny, and don't care that much for an action itself!10/10 would bang again!"
1853,Anonymous,30-Jul-13,10,"Not one of the best, this game is the best multiplayer 5v5 MOBA. Though a bit(actually a lot) hard to learn but once you know all of it, you will not find a better multiplayer game to play! "
1854,Anonymous,29-Jul-13,10,"This game has a way lower user score then the game deserves because League of Legends fan boyish Ftards are all over this game. Don't mind the score and give the game a try, you won't regret it."
1855,Anonymous,29-Jul-13,10,I love this game because of the balance gameplay and clean graphics. And also it is F2P and also I am a dota fan thats why I love this game... FTW XD 
1856,Anonymous,28-Jul-13,10,"Its simply the Greatest PC game ever made. Yes its hard, yes its unforgiving, and yes some of the community are a bunch of idiots... but don't let that put you off. Keep going with it.. once you have learned how to play there is no video game  PC game in the world that can touch it for awesomeness."
1858,Anonymous,27-Jul-13,10,"so perfect generation and strategy.Quality of characters are incredible.Teamplay is good.War effects amazing.League of Legends fans losers and kids,DotA 2 fans pros.Need all DotA heroes in DotA 2"
1861,Anonymous,27-Jul-13,10,"I've got almost 900 hours on record so far. I've played other games form this genre (LoL and HoN), and I have to say, DotA2 is by far the best.I love games with steep learning curves, where accumulating knowledge and sharpening skill is absolutely necessary for it to be playable.The game is very fun to play, the true online sportsmanship. Best game I've played in 10 years."
1865,Anonymous,26-Jul-13,10,"What can we ask more to this game?Very nice graphics, 100 and more heroes that are all free.The only thing missing is the ladder, which should come soon.Dota 2 For the Win. The most fun you can have online."
1868,Anonymous,25-Jul-13,10,"Free to play, high skill ceiling and 100% skill based gameplay. No need to spend a cent in order to ""have a chance"", all the paid items are cosmetic and gives 0 advantage. This game have no room for the ""casuals"" to just join up and mash buttons until they occasionally win. if you're not willing to learn about the game and earn your victories, then I suggest you stay away from DOTA 2."
1869,Anonymous,22-Jul-13,10,I don't see why people are giving this game a low rating just for the community. Yes they are really aggressive and that is something that should not dictate a games rating but I think this game is great and its free so why complain if you don't like it no problem its free.
1871,Anonymous,22-Jul-13,10,"best game ever, balanced heroes, no pay to win all you pay for is cosmetics, not only this but games are exhilterating and isnt about farmingit blows crappy league of legends out of the water"
1873,Anonymous,22-Jul-13,10,"Dota 2 is surprisingly a very good game, I myself enjoyed this game so much, I tried LoL but it did not compare. Just accept your defeat LoL players. Also GTFO if you just going to put 0 scores and give stupid reasons......"
1874,Anonymous,21-Jul-13,10,This was the game that League of Legends copied.to me it satisfies my hunger for really great PVP orientated  RPG Fantasy type games... taht dont' suck up all your life like World of Warcraft Arathi Basin etc etc.i have to admit i played this game since it was called Aeon of Strife... so i guess i dont' have to worry about the learning curve.
1875,Anonymous,21-Jul-13,10,"Few games manage to be both entertaining as well as extremely challenging, with a high learning curve, tons of different classes, customuzation, and in-game item builds. The game looks gorgeous, matches are lengthy, the community is friendly and well groomed, and the gameplay is as solid as it can get."
1877,Anonymous,20-Jul-13,10,"Only authentic FREE TO PLAY GAME in the whole Internet. That's pretty awesome. The ONE AND ONLY GAME that's doesn't give any advantage to expenders. Only CON, it's very addictive."
1879,Anonymous,20-Jul-13,10,"Can be a little rough for starters. But, the time you would put into learning from the tutorial system or youtube videos would be well worth it. You can check Purgegamers for gameplays which is what helped me learn this awesome game."
1880,Anonymous,20-Jul-13,10,This game takes critical thinking. That's why it's fun. You make decisions and learn from them. Working with friends or strangers over a relatively long period of time to dominate your enemy can be extremely fun. It's also awesome when notice yourself improving.
1882,Anonymous,20-Jul-13,10,"After Team Fortress 2, I would say it is the biggest and most successful creation of Valve. Even if the learning curve is steep  it's fun playing with friends.Moreover it's ""Free 2 Play""  enjoy "
1883,Anonymous,19-Jul-13,10,"Amazing game with a mountainous learning curve. The gameplay (once you get the hang of it) is hella fun. However there is so much more than just the gameplay that I love about dota 2. The trading is just as fun as playing, with a similar learning curve. Overall this game was very well done, is updated constantly, and is exactly on par with the kind of game valve typically puts out."
1885,Anonymous,19-Jul-13,10,"I've come to Dota from League of Legends and that was like changing 10 years old Toyota car to brand new Ferrari. Better community, better ingame, no lags, no servers down and most of all NO ANNOYING 10 YEARS OLD KIDS."
1886,Anonymous,18-Jul-13,10,"A faithful recreation of the game that inspired LoL and HoN. Valve absolutely nailed it, the graphical style and voice work are incredible. No pay2win but cosmetics for those who want them. 10/10"
1887,Anonymous,18-Jul-13,10,"One of the best multiplayer games of all time and it's FREE.  Much better than League of Legends, all heroes are FREE and it's deeper and more complex.  Very steep learning curve, may be too hard for the average Call of Duty casual gamer."
1888,Anonymous,18-Jul-13,10,What a game is this holy damn...Yesterday i played my first game and it was one of the best gaming experience in my life. My team  about the game having no surrender option but after 10 min we did such an amazing comeback we all bursted into spaming in allchat. BEST GAME EVER!
1889,Anonymous,18-Jul-13,10,"Played the first one a lot...have about 1300 hours in this one. THE BEST MOBA GAME EVER CREATED!It improves on every single thing that was bad in the first...and lets face it,whoever played DOTA 1 is BOUND to LOVE THIS ONE :DDota 2 best moba game hands down"
1890,Anonymous,17-Jul-13,10,"It's an Awesome game,Perfect at both video and audio quality. And it have all the good parts from DOTA1 and be taken out BUGs.DOTA2 is DOTA!! Game matching still not perfect but it's way hard to judge the power level of both sides' player. Absolute balance power is impossible.But Valve is still improving it~~Thx Valve and Icefrog,and Eul~~"
1892,Anonymous,17-Jul-13,10,Wasn't this hard to make the switch from League to DotA2. The Tutorial and Campaign is more than awesome and the game binds you from the first minute. An outstanding Moba and definitively the best Moba at the market.
1893,Anonymous,17-Jul-13,10,Many heroes that differ greatly differ and each is truly a special and despite this diversity which is the balance very well. The game play is perfect desert I mean what can be improved. In Dota 2 tournaments are held constant. Another nice fact is that it is the game soon for Linux and Mac give.
1894,Anonymous,17-Jul-13,10,"Dota 2 is what a real ""sequal"" should be like. The game is free, the graphics are pleasnt, the gameplay is fluid, and the game has great balance. Valve has done a great job, and hopefully the e-sports scene becomes bigger, because League of Legends is a joke in terms of quality and balance."
1895,Anonymous,17-Jul-13,10,"This game is amazing. It's balanced, free, and very fun to play. There is a pretty steep learning curve, but once you get past that there's really not much to complain about the game."
1896,Anonymous,17-Jul-13,10,"Best moba so far, perfect hero balancement, complex mechanics nice graphics and no pay to win, only needs matchmaking improvement.This game improved a lot since the first version."
1898,Anonymous,17-Jul-13,10,"Awesome game, if you are new to the genre just practice a lot, its hard at the start just try to reach the point where you enjoy the game even if you losePD: if you have emotional disorder, dont play this game"
1899,Anonymous,17-Jul-13,10,"The best strategy/co-op multiplayer game ever. A lot of efects, and too many heroes and itens for you to play. It nevers get bored. I definitely recommend this game."
1900,Anonymous,17-Jul-13,10,"Extremely fun and addictive game. Gameplay is complex but still fun even if you're only a casual gamer.Only problem is that it's a little hard to learn for a complete beginner, but that has recently been fixed with in-game tutorials."
1901,Anonymous,17-Jul-13,10,"The game runs great, carrying the brilliant albeit somewhat unintuitive nature of the wc3 mod to a stand-alone Engine.It's definitely clear that Valve puts lots of consideration and dedication into their work, Dota 2 is nothing short of superb."
1906,Anonymous,16-Jul-13,10,"This is an absolutely fantastic game that puts casual moba games, such as League of Legends, to shame. It's by far the best moba game out there, and just keeps getting better as they release new heroes that were in the original warcraft 3 mod."
1908,Anonymous,16-Jul-13,10,The oringinal sequal of DOTA!!!Fabulous!!!Dota 2 gives us a unique chance to experience the original DOTA experience!!The best MOBA game in the world.Thanks icefrog and valve for creating so much fun in dota 2I love this game so much!
1909,Anonymous,16-Jul-13,10,"Despite the steep learning curve, dota 2 is very fun and rewarding.  Best played with friend[s] to avoid the wrath of the internet thats bound to happen every now and then in this very competitive game."
1911,Anonymous,16-Jul-13,10,"Simply the best ""Dota"" game out there.Stop blaming about community, making the community better is everyone's duty, anyway, it's not the game's fault.Try it, especially if you are tired of LoL--  Dota2 is far more challenging and flexible."
1912,Anonymous,16-Jul-13,10,"Very addicting with a steep learning curve, you'll sink many hours into this game. Of course there will be abrasive players in the community, but guess what, there are function in the game to fix it. Mute and report the player(s), and play on. GL HF"
1913,Anonymous,16-Jul-13,10,"Valve did a great job by hiring Icefrog, you can't find such a balanced game without Icefrog and you can't find such a great detailed game without ValveBalanced Game  Competitive game  Greatly detailed  GOTY 2013 :D"
1917,Anonymous,16-Jul-13,10,"I've been playing DOTA off and on for at least 7 years. It's become a part of my life like golf or the NBA.  I can't thank Valve enough for bringing modernity to the game and making it a viable E-Sport.  If I were to laud two improvements, it would be the matchmaking system and the shop in the game."
1918,Anonymous,16-Jul-13,10,"Let me get it out straight away   DotA 2 is probably the most fun and satisfaction I got in a multiplayer game.I'll just list everything great about this game:the aesthetics are great, the art and the graphics are gorgeous, the competition feel is big. The replay-ability of the game is infinite.Most importantly  it's free, so just install Steam and install it as soon as possible."
1924,Anonymous,16-May-20,9,You can say whatever you want but Dota is the best MOBA game created so far. Yes its not the most handsome looking game. Gameplay is way more complicated than LoL and HotS.  Thats why i understand lot of negative score from crybabies.
1926,Anonymous,20-Feb-20,9,"I spent 2000+ hours on this game. Although I am not good at it anymore, but I am still willing to play it with friends."
1927,Anonymous,05-Feb-20,9,"I give you 100%  you won't find better, more complicated, complex and interesting mmo pvp game better than this one."
1928,Anonymous,04-Feb-20,9,I didn't expect to like Dota 2 much. But I think the game is fine. It is not perfect but it is fine. I've played thousands hours of it. I don't *love* it. But yeah... it is an okay game.
1933,Anonymous,26-Nov-18,9,All you need is like a premium game but is totally free to play. Statistics replays you can watch games from players perspective a lot of mechanics strategy and more. The Best Moba Game and great E-Sport.
1934,Anonymous,14-Aug-18,9,Do you know that compulsive gaming is mental disorder? I did not. But after so many hours with that treacherous game I know that i developed some kind of retardation...Take care! Play only 1 hour a day!
1935,Anonymous,22-Jul-18,9,"If you can get past the ladder anxiety and sometimes bad community (that happens when you are playing with 4 random people), the game itself is really deep and rewarding. Even after thousands of hours you have so much to learn and get better at. If you are competitive and can get past the steep learning curve, it's really rewarding."
1936,Anonymous,03-Jun-18,9,-1 for community. Great game bot one minus makes it completely unplayable..
1937,Anonymous,10-May-18,9,"Plays very different to compared League of legends, but has great character design and a very complex game play. If you get used to the more slower movement it is a great game, that will keep you playing for many hours. Beware, players can be toxic!"
1938,Anonymous,04-Apr-17,9,"Best time killer I've ever seen. Thanks for killing a great part of my youth. I hate and I love this game at the same time. If not for the toxic community, the game would be close to ideal."
1939,Anonymous,05-Nov-16,9,"Getting better with age, very organic competitive scene unlike other big titles.They need to work on behaviour and ranked match-making but otherwise really fun and you've always got tons of room to growSeemsGood"
1941,Anonymous,06-Oct-16,9,Rating Dota 2 appropriately can be a hard thing to do. It sure is one of the most complex and demanding multiplayer games out there with a merciless community that tends to make it hard for newcomers to get into the groove and appreciate the game for what it really is: A strategy game balanced so masterfully that each and every single hero has its place and use.
1942,Anonymous,19-Feb-16,9,"Inevitably the greatest MOBA of all time. An instant classic that lives up to its predecessor's name & continues to deliver with constant changes & additional content. Dota 2 always feels like a refreshing experience, although it may not be so forgiving for players new to the genre, or those used to simpler MOBA's like League of Legends."
1943,Anonymous,12-Feb-16,9,Sometimes game become cancer simulator sometimes its becomes very fun game sometimes its becomes challange dota 2 offer too much.Best moba with inf. play time
1944,Anonymous,25-Jan-16,9,"Great game... also it's free. ONE COMPLAINT: Seriously? Such a great game with only one map? It gets boring sometimes, but its usually made up with the fact that the game just is great."
1946,Anonymous,06-Sep-15,9,"yes the graphics are out dated but this game is really good it dosent have op heroes, if you play too much it might get addicting and frustrating over all its a pretty good game"
1947,Anonymous,04-Sep-15,9,"Dota 2 is a really fun game you can choose 100 heroes to play as, i know the dota community is bad but come on just enjoy the fun and ignore those stupid people that are hating"
1948,Anonymous,23-Jun-15,9,I've spent a lot of hours playing this game. If you're really into competition gaming then I do NOT recommend this game.Matchmaking system is a joke. Game is brilliant but if you're up to increasing your skills and fighting vs good opponents with good players in your team then forget it. Just abandon this game and don't play it unless you have 4 friends going the same way you're going.
1949,Anonymous,27-Dec-14,9,"Just play it. You will love it. But you'll need some friends, cause the community is generally terrible and full of angry dicks. Also its free. That's a **** value."
1952,Anonymous,21-Dec-14,9,"Playing This game for a long time and it is still fun! Together with my friends we always have fun playing this game. The Game Improved great!  Challenging other people's heroes,Teamwork is really needed and must be the first thing keep in mind,don't Be an **** 2 is great Moba game!"
1954,Anonymous,25-Oct-14,9,"I personally think this game has a bit of a learning curve, but: when you know how to play it can make time pass by and you just want to play another game after you won one, you can make friends from Dota 2 and in some situations it can give you a thrill. I would have rated this game higher if they had an option to vs people at your own level. 9/10"
1955,Anonymous,08-Sep-14,9,"Very good game especially with friends. Being one of over 100 heroes is an awesome feeling and it's awesome to play. The only bad think is learning the game, tutorials are good, but you have to figure out some things by yourself."
1956,Anonymous,29-Aug-14,9,"Great game, free to play, free updates, hell even the cosmetics you pay for you can get for free, well not realistically, but you get the point. Fiddling with the custom map maker, also free, having fun with that. Wish more people played least played mode, I feel that's the best environment to learn heroes."
1957,Anonymous,28-Aug-14,9,"Since the game started as a patch on WC3 TFT, the game kept evolving. But when it was released as Dota 2, the game mechanics, heroes and features are not getting better in means that dont make profit. But it is the best MOBA out there."
1958,Anonymous,17-Aug-14,9,Awesome. Game Nice graphics.Just Server issues which really suck as they Give Low priority. Otherwise its good game.Its best game in Free to play category.
1959,Anonymous,18-Apr-14,9,diretide madafakers    ..
1965,Anonymous,07-Apr-14,9,For me the best MOBA there is to play. It is very difficult and challenging to new players but if you grab a few friends that are on the same skill level that you are you are going to have a blast. My only gripe with the game is that you can see what heroes the enemy team picks so counter picking is a really annoying thing to do but is done often.
1966,Anonymous,20-Mar-14,9,"Valve gave great tutorial about this game and the gaming system is great. With MMR system, you can hone your skill in playing such game. Also this game offer many cosmetics, though some are overpriced in my opinion. This game is addictive."
1970,Anonymous,14-Mar-14,9,gtfo league fanboys and stop hating on dota because you decided to play the n00b moba and found dota too hard for you lololololololololololololololololol
1971,Anonymous,17-Feb-14,9,"This one of my favorite games - appears simple but is devilishly complex. You'll want to proceed through the entire tutorial, and then ease into multiplayer, expecting significant early failure. Stick with it though, and experience one of the finest in free to play competitive RTS."
1972,Anonymous,30-Jan-14,9,"This game is awesome. This 180 degrees better than the previous game. It has more better graphic, more easily to play and the most I love is this game has the build guide that makes newbie can join to play too :)"
1973,Anonymous,20-Dec-13,9,"One of the best, competitive games I've ever played. It is free, so get all your friends battle for the most epic Action Real Time Strategy game ever!!!!"
1976,Anonymous,28-Nov-13,9,"Have played dota 2 for about 1500 hours now and it is such a awesome game... Such a big variety of heroes, Items, Spells etc. Very hard to learn/master at first  some hate from people when you do bad, But when you get past beginners stage it's really a blast to play... Defiantly recommend!"
1977,Anonymous,26-Nov-13,9,"i'ts one of the best rpg that i have ever played in my computer, i'ts completely free, not an pay-to-win, and have a very nice gameplay  i really loved it!Valve are doing quite of a job in here "
1978,Anonymous,22-Nov-13,9,"Diretide came later, so what? Its a free game, and one of the best of its Kind. But thats the DOTA community as you have to love them, always nagging and whining :P.Dont bother about those guys, it may be frustrating some times, but it will be worth it "
1980,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,9,"The best ""MOBA"" out there. Art, gameplay, depth, everything is 10 out of 10. Dota 2 is just an amazing game!  Moreover, diretide is given! Learning curve is massive, however."
1981,Anonymous,10-Nov-13,9,It's beatiful no tears just dreams. It's beatiful no tears just dreams. It's beatiful no tears just dreams.  It's beatiful no tears just dreams. It's beatiful no tears just dreams. It's beatiful no tears just dreams.
1982,Anonymous,10-Nov-13,9,"Just a fun fact about the rating system, 90% of these negative reviews recently have stemmed from a pile of whiny entitled gamers who had a holiday event cancelled (eventually turned out to just be a delay), so effectively add about 2-3 points to the score, and subtract about 2500 negative reviews (mainly the 0s) from consideration."
1984,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,9,"An incredible free to play multiplayer game that, once you've scaled the learning wall, offers endless hours of nuanced combat and strategy. Though the community can be harsh, those with thick skin will persevere and lose countless hours of their life to this addictive ARTS."
1985,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,9,"Quite simply an amazing game. While it is very hardcore and timewise highly impractical, it pays off in a game with unprecedented depth and supports so many different playstyles. It's no 10 because I feel while it has gone gold, there are enough bugs (non game-breaking) and valve has yet to begin adding their own heroes. Also custom maps are not implemented yet."
1987,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,9,"Hard to get into but with time put into learning to play, it can be a very rewarding game. Community full of  complete and utter  though unfortunately."
1988,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,9,"Free, polished gameplay, thriving esports scene, dedicated developer, enthusiastic community. Win all round. High barrier to entry but definitely worth it."
1989,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,9,"It's a great game. Volvo has appologized for the lack of diretide. It a shame that some people felt the need to spam diretide comments, but it's a great game with rich mechanics, and great gameplay. But community suck hard."
1992,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,9,"They gave dire tide, and have continually improved the game over the last few years.Steep learning curve, and crappy match making are the only downside on these two."
1993,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,9,"Thank you for listening to our complaints and responding to us.I rate the game 9-10, due to bugs, other then that I would recommend this game to anyone willing to spend the time to lean it."
1995,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,9,"this is one of my personal favorite games, i have played it for well over 660 hours and i can definitely say that some of my best memories in games have come from here. sadly also some of the worst to. come with a thick skin and no anger and you will be fine"
1996,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,9,The game is amazing and well balanced. The only thing that need to improve is increasing the number of employee dedicated exclusively with Dota2. The fact that Valve step back and finally talked about Diretide is a good and valuable point.
1997,Anonymous,05-Nov-13,9,"Nice game, but crappy community, the only bad thing i see about the game, is the matchmaking, it has to be improved ASAP, i love the game but joining pubs alone is a bad experience."
1999,Anonymous,04-Nov-13,9,"Very good game. Good game play, takes a while to get into it but once you do, oh boy, one you do, there ain't no going back. By the way the people who give it 0 for one little thing need to stop "
2000,Anonymous,04-Nov-13,9,"All the frustrated lol trolls decided to show up on metacritic. No server lag here since I have been playing it, cosmetics are nice but wish there was more to purchase than hero sets,courier skins and hud skins.The only complaint I have is the the dota loading emblem, on start up it tends to pixelate very harshly."
2001,Anonymous,04-Nov-13,9,"Amazing game with sophisticated mechanics, and 100% F2P, only pay for cosmetics that do not give any advantage and all heroes from the beginning free."
2002,Anonymous,04-Nov-13,9,This game obviously lacks completeness and suffers from imperfect matchmaking system but giving it '0' for not implementing Halloween event feels kind of a childish action.
2003,Anonymous,03-Nov-13,9,You people that are spamming dota 2 and saying its a terrible game are  idiots  just because you dont get a event you start spamming valve for no reason after what theyve done  immature kids
2005,Anonymous,03-Nov-13,9,"One of the best mobas of today.  Requires timing  coordination with your teammates, inteligence..The only problem is sometimes the matchmaking that puts you with totally new people and sometimes people get mad (like myself) because of this."
2006,Anonymous,02-Nov-13,9,"This is truly an amazing and masterfully crafted game. It's absolutely pathetic that some members of the community think it's okay to ruin the User Score by being entitled brats. Don't let all the ""bad"" reviews turn you off from this game."
2010,Anonymous,02-Nov-13,9,"Guys, this is  retarded. Diretide isn't going to happen. And spam bombing the game you love so much with negative reviews won't help. Way to look like "
2012,Anonymous,02-Nov-13,9,"This game is amazing and so addictive. I can't drop it. I normally wouldn't do a review because the score was pretty good, but the spammers are making me do this. They're retarded."
2013,Anonymous,02-Nov-13,9,"If it wasn't a coin-flipping simulator, this game would get a 10.- matchmaking is broken in certain modes (all pick).- as with all games in the ARTS genre, the community is quite toxic.- a lot of non-US foreigners play well, but sometimes it's a nuisance.- gameplay has incredible depth and complexity and is very rewarding."
2014,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,9,"This game is amazing. They patch it often enough (though some would say that missing a seasonal holiday patch  dead game). Endless gameplay possibilities and awesome art, best MOBA I've ever played."
2015,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,9,"Do not play this game, you cannot get anything, nor fun, nor balance, nor fairness, nor friends, you will get nothing and all thanks to Valve and their milking-ruining game model."
2016,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,9,Give DIRETIDE and NEW HEROESGive DIRETIDE and NEW HEROESGive DIRETIDEand NEW HEROESGive DIRETIDE and NEW HEROESGive DIRETIDE and NEW HEROESGive DIRETIDE and NEW HEROESGive DIRETIDE and NEW HEROES
2017,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,9,"Very good game. The only F2P game worth spending money on. One of the best out there. Only problem is some poor matchmaking, and Valve's inability to tell us 'No Diretide' (Yes, this has nothing to do with the game it self, however still represents DotA as a whole)."
2020,Anonymous,29-Sep-13,9,"Pretty nice game One of the best, most difficult and truly competitive games I've ever played. It is free and doesn't have any pay-to-win, all heroes are free, the only paid content are cosmetical items that DO NOT change gameplay."
2021,Anonymous,22-Sep-13,9,Dota 2 have all you need from a free to play for 1000 hours of fun. How many game can entertain you for thousands of hours with only 1 map? I choosed 9 instead of 10 point because there is no real control for bad players and the matchmaking is very slow.
2022,Anonymous,10-Sep-13,9,"There is a GIANT learning curve and a very unforgiving community that goes with this game.  But if you do your research and find a good group to play with, then DOTA 2 is, IMO, the best MOBA game currently out today."
2023,Anonymous,07-Sep-13,9,"It's one of the best Multiplayer game, but also there's a lot of noobs. Please, play Dota 2 after playing blizzard strategy games or League of Legends"
2024,Anonymous,25-Aug-13,9,THIS GAME IS AWESOME!! I'm PLAYING DOTA 1 BUT DOTA 2 IS MUCH AWESOMER!! AND VERY ADDICTING!! AND GREAT VOICE ACTORS ANIMATIONS BUT THERES A FEW BUGS BUT ITS GONNA FIXED BY PATCH SO THATS ISN'T GONNA AFFECT THE SCORE!
2027,Anonymous,23-Aug-13,9,"In the beginning I was arguing why a game where you start from 0 every match could be that addictive. As soon as I started playing I got shocked about the immersion this game provides. Although, I would strongly prefer more heroes..."
2028,Anonymous,18-Aug-13,9,This game is AWESOME. The only two downs it's the inability of playing on a local lan and the discrepancy of pub players. Summarizing  BEST PLAYED WITH FRIENDS 
2029,Anonymous,12-Aug-13,9,"Fantastic controls, graphics, and gameplay. One of the best PvP games I've ever played and a LARGE improvement to the first Dota. Valve honestly couldn't have done any better."
2032,Anonymous,05-Aug-13,9,"There are so much in this game, it is even hard to start to write about it. Everyone should give it a ""shoot"". The characters and the chance of customization makes it even better."
2033,Anonymous,30-Jul-13,9,"This game is amazing, although many people say that  lives in DotA. Valve and IceFrog worked so hard, and they continue their work, adding new heroes and debugging the game, so I think that Dota 2 becomes better and better, and it will be one of the most recollectable game of the 2010's."
2035,Anonymous,28-Jul-13,9,"Great game, well balanced all heroes are available from the get go. Matchmaking and player community maybe the game's only downfalls. The cosmetic equipment along with the couriers allow for a lot of trading and community interaction a very nice feature considering steam's already large player base..."
2036,Anonymous,26-Jul-13,9,A good game if you play with your friends... you can really enjoy it! but if you are planning to play alone I advice you to just play your roll and don't read or listen what the others have to say 
2037,Anonymous,26-Jul-13,9,"I played both LoL and dota 2 and by far Dota 2 is best!! First of all in grafics ,amazing work! And of course its more challenging! the only bad i can find is the noob russians! they are everywhere and they dont speak english at all when they have a choise about language in server selection!"
2038,Anonymous,23-Jul-13,9,"I've been playing this game for quite some time now and I can say that while I enjoyed original DotA, this one is more polished and the gameplay is very smooth. The graphics are amazing too and the community has been quite helpful so far (even though some people say otherwise).I totally recommend this game to any MOBA fan."
2039,Anonymous,22-Jul-13,9,"Traditional and innovativeDota 2; Moba to continue and further development of its kind that was a game. Valve, it will move to a better location anyway. Valve created wish you continued success. To make the game more innovative Valve should do more than their best."
2041,Anonymous,22-Jul-13,9,"This game is like COD, hard at first but once you get the hang of it you get pretty decent. I found this game amazing and yet it had its challenging moments but it it an overall amazing game. I we can't forget its free!"
2043,Anonymous,19-Jul-13,9,Never got into Dota....But i love Dota 2 and i'm not into MOBA games or even MP games that much that are not coop games. But dota 2 has coop! I love the UI and how it has it's own Friends and invite UI and lessons on how to play. Fun game.
2045,Anonymous,18-Jul-13,9,Not a 10 because of the matching system. You jump from very good games to complete nonsense where you just wonder wtf (and you know that you have to waste 40 mins in a bad match-up)?Overall a very good game.
2047,Anonymous,16-Jul-13,9,"Dota 2 is a great game. I like its UI design, hero design and that beautiful map. Valve didn't disappoint players this time. However, the only reason I do not give a 10 is that this game still have some bugs and Valve has already released it. Those bugs do damage the game experience."
2048,Anonymous,16-Jul-13,9,"I have to say, DotA is the best moba ever.BUT, I don't wanna look like a racist but those Russians keep raping the game.I can't even report them because Valve gives us only 2 reports a day.If Valve actually does something about Russians, I'd gladly change my score to 10."
2049,Anonymous,15-Jul-13,9,"The first time I played Dota 2, The opposing team did not show us any mercy, and I loved every second of it. This game is so addicting and fun, I didnt even care about winning or losing. Great characters, Epic Gameplay  TeamWork  Wide range of Options and all out fun are all available in Dota 2. A must Have"
2053,Anonymous,21-Aug-20,8,I love this game. its my most played game ever. BUT you must deal with toxicity tho.
2055,Anonymous,26-Jul-20,8,"Nice Game ,i like the way how they patch this game ,use any strategy to win a game unlike League of Legend."
2056,Anonymous,19-Jun-20,8,"A good game with excellent gameplay, soundtrack, a wide variety of parties. But the poor community and the need for a lot of time in the game."
2057,Anonymous,21-May-16,8,"Fun game, free can you get all the character. It's a pretty solid and well polish moba. Yeah you get the usual toxic moba community, but that's in every moba."
2058,Anonymous,15-Jan-16,8,"Dota is by far the best moba i have played. It is complex and ever changing. Its fun and punishing, but also rewarding. Its played best when witch friends.However, when u don't have the luxury of playing with people you know it is filled with the most toxic player base I have ever seen."
2059,Anonymous,07-Dec-15,8,It's a great misery simulator for an average guy like me but even I can see how great of an impact to the industry it is and for a good reason. It's a great game for who's cup of tea it is.
2061,Anonymous,10-Oct-15,8,"Dota is a horribly game, very badly designed  when I was going to play my first match I discovered that the community is really unsupportive not beginner-friendly I just need 3 words to describe this game WORST COMUNNITY EVER"
2062,Anonymous,10-Jun-15,8,"Great game, constant game improvements/changes keep the game fresh. Very addictive.Cons, community is populated by toxic players. Hopefully this game doesn't ruin any of your friendships."
2066,Anonymous,23-Nov-14,8,"Since I spend more than 1 thousand hours playing a game I cant say it's not enjoyable. Game has nice style, music, voices, effects and most importantly - gameplay. The only disappointment are players."
2069,Anonymous,10-Oct-14,8,"3,729 lol fan here :) But to tell the truth, Dota 2 is the best MOBA game that currently is f2p. And it is not left alone. They still upgrade it and patch. I believe in valve."
2070,Anonymous,22-Feb-14,8,Don't say that this game is bad... of course league of legends is better ( it has more 5 years in it's age)... but Dota is pretty good too i hope this community changes. The graphics are epic and the game play it is not so good but you can play it very well. Review your ideas about this game!
2071,Anonymous,03-Feb-14,8,"Story: 2 out of 10, Graphics: 8 out of 10, Fun: 9 out of 10, Controls: 7 out of 10, Ease to Learn: 3 out of 10, Multi-player: 9 out of 10, Length: 6 out of 10, Re-play: 9 out of 10, Value: 9 out of 10"
2072,Anonymous,31-Jan-14,8,"Nice game, nice graphics and sounds. Very good gameplay. It's a cooperative RTS so it could be very stressful, a match could last an hour. Anyway the interface is pretty and very clean and the game is well balanced. Just perfect for it's genre (beside the aforementioned design choices)."
2074,Anonymous,02-Dec-13,8,"Amazing, unique game. Only thing is there are just so much heroes its pretty hard to figure out which one is your favorite, the tutorial introduces you to a couple of them but there are alot more out there that players will miss on because they want to stick to the heroes they know."
2075,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,8,This game is completely free to play so the only barrier on entry is player skill.  There is even a tutorial nowadays so that new players aren't completely left to sink or swim like old-school gamers were.
2076,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,8,"It's definitely a great game, really fun and addicting. Not perfect at all, there are far too many bugs that have yet to be patched for it to be a 10. The community can be very frustrating in game and on forums but that doesn't detract from the gameplay."
2078,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,8,"I am very glad that you talked to the players. Why not do it always in advance? If you are not ready to release the update, tell us, we all understand.Tnx for information, Valve."
2081,Anonymous,02-Nov-13,8,"In my opinion, the game is perfect. Even though you played for about 3-4(or more) years, the game is still fun. This shows how skillful you are at skirmishes (teamfights), teamwork, and most of all MATURITY.I just don't get why some people are sooooooo immature. That's why I rated Dota 2 8 because of its bad (very) community. "
2083,Anonymous,02-Nov-13,8,"Tactically speaking there is a lot more to this than most basic pvp fests. Even playing against bots can be fun. I have to say I wasn't expecting when I got on this page such a huge backlash but then I guess we're talking about the kind of people for whom a game that costs you nothing and is lovingly crafted and designed just isn't good enough,"
2084,Anonymous,02-Nov-13,8,This game is actually amazing. Easily the best in the genre. Valve could communicate/listen to the community more but that doesn't change the game. Shame the community has reacted in this fashion.
2085,Anonymous,02-Nov-13,8,"The game is great. The online team fights are awesome and there are a lot of customizable items. Sure Valve has it's problems with communication, but the game itself is really good."
2086,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,8,Don't bother with this game the developer has just trolled the entire community and has zero respect for it's player base Matchmaking is broken to the point of 1000 wins players being grouped against 2 wins players no region locking...and no diretide
2087,Anonymous,30-Oct-13,8,"This is a great game! My only problem with it would be the community it has. It has a horrible community full of people who think they are better than everyone else, and constantly yell at you for messing up once. I play with friends though, so this really isn't a problem for me. Even if I'm in a game with  teammates, I just ignore them and enjoy the game! "
2088,Anonymous,07-Oct-13,8,Classic MOBA .Easy 2 Play.Good graphic whoever come from DotA 1 want to play DotA 2 you can play easily. if you want better graphic than WC3 you must play DotA 2  now Dota 2 is available on Steam it's free to play mean everyone can play Dota 2
2089,Anonymous,05-Oct-13,8,"This is a great RPG/strategy game.  In one hour you can have the satisfaction of hacking and slashing, leveling up, buying items, fighting bosses (other players) and beating the game.  All in all a very satisfying experience, Though the learning curve can be a little steep, depending upon how deep you want to delve into this game.  It gets deep!"
2090,Anonymous,28-Sep-13,8,"This game is extremely addictive and can be even more fun if in a party of people. Teams really make the game the best and the more you play, the better you are as the character. enjoy sitting down and spending an hour or two playing this game."
2091,Anonymous,08-Sep-13,8,"This game is pure awesomeness. I hate with they did with the release though. The beta was MUCH BETTER FUN THAN THE RELEASE. The gold feature was annoying, but it didn't ruin the game play. Killing baddies was hard, but rewarding. The choice of heroes is crazy! Thus being made by Valve, we won't being a third to this game. Overall, this game is good, but can be approved more."
2092,Anonymous,01-Sep-13,8,"one of the best newold game in steam.Valve version of dota do a real quality,but time show can Valve add some newgood features in classic defence of ancient.Score only 8 becouse 1)This retared Pro-Dota community 2)Usless workshopdonate.Time will show how good a Valve Dota."
2093,Anonymous,30-Aug-13,8,"A very competitive game, and a very tactical one is the only way i can describe this game. And to me  that is a good thing. Above all else, it feels great to win a game against a good team."
2094,Anonymous,22-Aug-13,8,"It's a really well made game, with lots of customization and characters to choose from. It ain't my thing though, but it still is a well made game. You'll like it if you are a LoL fan or that kind of stuff"
2095,Anonymous,02-Aug-13,8,DOTA 2 is probably one of the best games this year.It is fun playing this games and every challenges is very challenging.Still this game should be on the top this year.
2097,Anonymous,20-Jul-13,8,"The game was well improved by their new character models,graphics,sounds and gameplays. The developers also allow users to create their own customization of the models.The developers also feature levels,stats,tournaments,live gameplay and battle history.But this game also has a problem like glitches and bugs.And lastly the game updates every weekend."
2098,Anonymous,05-Jun-20,7,"The game itself is very good. But Valve do not care for the game, the disgusting community, terrible patches. Therefore, this is a maximum of 7."
2099,Anonymous,12-Feb-20,7,DOTA was great but for me it ended with reborn as it good worse and worse everyday.
2102,Anonymous,17-Sep-15,7,"This game feels old, I used to play DotA and was really fun (and that's why I gave this game a 7) but right now this game is no better than any other MOBA, there are not interesting updates, the item system is a joke and the new reborn release created a lot of bugs in the classic mode so don't expect any new heroes soon."
2103,Anonymous,21-Jan-14,7,"I'm waiting Terrorblade long while not adding the hero awaited by me and many I did not come back to play it, already disappointed several times and am no joker to reveal more than onceI'm passionate about the game, but when icefrog took care of him was much better, this valve breaking several fans."
2104,Anonymous,01-Jan-14,7,"I played Dota for a long time, but was frustrated with the heroes who used magic because the damage does not increase with the items (some only). Hard to imagine a mage with items of intelligence becomes stronger in physical damage. For this and other reasons currently playing LoL."
2105,Anonymous,29-Dec-13,7,"terrible community, new heroes take forever to release and all that's being released are unnecessary cosmetics, seems to me that valve just cares about making money. On the bright side, it's free to play and has really good gameplay. Certainly the best moba game there is right now."
2106,Anonymous,25-Nov-13,7,"It's fun for a while, although gets repetitive after a while due to there being only one map. There are MAJOR balance issues, which makes the game utterly irritating to play, not to mention the god-awful ""community"". All in all though, pretty fun game."
2107,Anonymous,12-Nov-13,7,"Great game but the abandon rules are ridiculous. Just got a 24h ban because i arrived a few seconds after the 5 min limit since my game crashed and didn't restart in time and therefore got an abandon and a loss, even though i returned and won the game."
2108,Anonymous,03-Nov-13,7,"One of the best Games ever created.But no ranking/ladder systemAnd the skill pool, where equal player should play together, sucks!Hope they will change that"
2110,Anonymous,02-Nov-13,7,"LOL fanboys, get the  out. The game may not be innovating, the game may not worth the time waiting, but it's fun and entertaining. and it definitely deserves more than 0s. So why don't you douche bags go masturbating and let the ones that really played it give it a score?"
2111,Anonymous,02-Nov-13,7,I love Dota 2 and cause it I won't give bad mark. BUT I NEED DIRETIDE. #give_diretide #give_event.    VALVE GIVE DIRETIDE    VALVE GIVE DIRETIDE    VALVE GIVE DIRETIDE
2112,Anonymous,02-Nov-13,7,"Best MOBA game so far, but updates are not so commonand for sureNO DiretideNO New HeroNO UpdatesNO Normal matchmaking systemAnd A lot of different useless stuf"
2114,Anonymous,02-Nov-13,7,This is one of the most boring games I've ever played! MOBA games in general are only for brainless drones. Valve really dropped the ball with this one.
2115,Anonymous,23-Sep-13,7,"After I saw this game was free on Steam, I decided what could be the harm? As I had never played any games in the same genre, this was something new. At first, I did not like it. I didn't 'get it.' After I forced myself to get past the beginning, it was quite an enjoyable experience. While not the best game I have ever played, it is still very good and in-depth."
2116,Anonymous,01-Aug-13,7,"It is like the original but not as good, yeah it has improved graphiques and etc. but I will stay with the original. However it`s a great free 2play game and give it a try."
2117,Anonymous,21-Jul-13,7,"I like some of the graphics, but other parts are too dark, too murky and make it impossible to see what is going on. Some of the character art is amazing, but some is just bad for no reason. The shop system is too complex and should have been much improved from DOTA."
2119,Anonymous,11-Mar-21,6,Too complex as for the PvP arena genre. And too many toxic people always knowing better what you should do.
2120,Anonymous,09-Feb-20,6,"Very toxic players, lack of fast paced gameplay,  realistic but not enjoyable graphics. .Graphics:5/10Sounds: 5/10Gameplay: 5/10Stabilization: 10/10"
2121,Anonymous,25-Oct-19,6,Can still be very fun depending on the players you get in your matches but the underlying game has totally devolved over the years.
2122,Anonymous,26-Feb-18,6,"Dota 2 - this game i could play always, but everything comes to an end. Too much toxic players."
2123,Anonymous,04-Apr-16,6,"DOTA 2 is a great improvement and standalone successor for its Warcraft III version. Everything is remastered, from graphics to user-friendliness, to bring out your addictive online multiplayer RTS game. Although personally, I haven't been blown away as I have played DOTA 1 for years.Plus, it updates and patches way too frequently."
2124,Anonymous,22-Jan-16,6,hardcore game for hardcore players. this is not a play for fun game. you need to give your blood and soul for this game.so if you want a casual game stay away or check it out if you have the time you need to invest.
2125,Anonymous,21-Aug-15,6,"Items pretty much take away from the pacing of the game.  Heroes of the Storm takes DOTA 2 and makes it much better, eliminating the tedium parts of the game that exist here and in LoL.However, the game looks great and controls well."
2127,Anonymous,31-Aug-14,6,"This game seems like fun but beware, the community will be will very rude to you if you haven't somehow managed to get good at the game without ever having played it. I received so much abuse from other players that I had to quit out. It could have been because I chose one of the most important characters and my ineptness was causing people to lost the game, but still..."
2128,Anonymous,18-Jan-14,6,This game is not great for the next generation of first Dota. Because the game with big size and have only few improment. First Dota only need under 10 mb for one map. This is very not great.
2129,Anonymous,02-Nov-13,6,"Is a good game on every level BUT is stupidly build around and infinite number of entry barriers for new players. Learn to play is sickening but if you do you will enjoy for sure. Also, there's that, you don't enjoy Dota 2 until you really mastered it wich is a bad thing, Imo."
2130,Anonymous,02-Nov-13,6,"This is rate of valve work, dont want add heroes, dont want make new modes, dont want fix bugs, only stupid items and disbalance patches. Valve, think about this and do it better. So waiting for work from valve"
2131,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,6,"This game had a good start, then it slowly became something else. I just don't understand why did Valve seem to abandon this game. The developing process has became really slow, but the worst thing is that they REFUSE to communicate with the community. I used to love everything Valve does, but nowadays it's just like they are a different company in a very negative way."
2132,Anonymous,25-Jul-13,6,"This game is interesting and is nice for playing with friends. On the other hand, learning curve is hard and the community is full of very rude players.

2134,Anonymous,30-Mar-21,5,My all time favourite PC game and the most competitive exciting eSport out there.
2135,Anonymous,12-Dec-20,5,"This game was awesome in 2012-2014, before Valve take the idea of their POPULAR"" games like TF2. The problem of dota 2 is worstest community ever, if you wanted to play once in pub you will never turn on this game at all. Next problem is longest updates i had ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All you doing full 5 months it is taking more and more sets to buy. (c) flu7s"

Now game is noting like this, but still best moba imo"
2143,Anonymous,24-Mar-15,5,"While it is a good multiplayer game in theory, it's actually a sub-par gaming experience in general because of the terrible playerbase and community, horribly flawed matchmaking system, blatant cashgrab events, and overpriced cosmetic market."
2145,Anonymous,17-Dec-14,5,"This game is pretty good but i own too much no real challenge in this game... 6000 rating and i only play meepo which is considered the hardest character, but hey this game is totally easy and fun. I guess this is a kids game"

2148,Anonymous,06-Dec-13,5,"If you enjoy the MOBA style game play, DOTA 2 is for you.  Constantly updated and always being reworked in.  The game is easy to learn but difficult to get good at/master."
2150,Anonymous,10-Nov-13,5,honestly this game is ok but it needs better matchmaking because every match i have some selfish prick who queues in english when he can't even speak it.

2156,Anonymous,11-Oct-13,5,"I love the original DOTA because the campaign was great and lots of mods. DOTA 2's graphic is better,though. But the community was the worst nightmare for newbies or even the pros."
2157,Anonymous,27-Sep-13,5,Kind of hard to get started in due to the existence of various game mechanics ranging from unfamiliar to difficult. The game design is decent but the UI isn't really user-friendly.

2160,Anonymous,21-Jun-18,4,"The game is great (though I do not like the genre) but the community, amount of time to get good at the game and the most important THE TIME YOU WASTE ON THE GAME is too much."
2161,Anonymous,23-Jun-14,4,"Community is horrendous and Valve has no clue what to do  or how to fix it. Million Russians are playing on EU servers, they don't know how to play, they won't listen, they don't speak English and they don't care when they destroy match. They simply flame you, report you and go on to next match."
2162,Anonymous,26-Dec-13,4,"Abusive and annoying community. Very basic game. Character design and image is very minimal and adds now really feel to them. You need a very good PC to run the game properly and smoothly, despite the graphics looking dated.Try other MMOBAs before returning to this one."
2163,Anonymous,05-Dec-13,4,"When I decided to give this a try, I was already aware of its infamous reputation for being harmful. All of the negative rumors you hear are true. It will make the most friendly of people aggressively competitive, while ignoring the game's extremely low fun factor.Dota 2 is bad."

2166,Anonymous,20-Nov-13,4,"the community is trash, there is not rating, or anything that help you not to be paired with ""noobs""  (LOL has this i believe) and HoN definitely has it, so yeah, valve is more worried about selling sets and stuff for heroes and make money instead of improving the game"

2212,Anonymous,12-Dec-13,2,Possibly one of the worst communities I have ever seen in any online game. Was insulted and my first game resulted in one smurf on the enemy team spawn trapping us and calling us bad and other derogatory names. I strongly recommend you stay away from this game.

2218,Anonymous,13-Sep-13,2,"The game is very unbalanced, most of the time a pool of around 20 out of the 100 heroes are picked. Not even because they're the most fun, but because they will win you the game. It might not deserve quit as low as what I have given it but trust me, it's not worth your time."

It seems when the community wants something to alleviate language barriers, they can't even respond to them, but if someone is bartering their games, then they nip it asap. Money hungry pigs."

2261,Anonymous,18-Nov-13,1,Not really understandable why they did not just take the real Dota as it was improved graphics and wiped out some flaws of the game. Also silly and unexplainable new features like no surrender option which in case u have an afk in ur team makes it impossible to finish the game quickly even though its long lost. Support and cummunity are the worse than any other i have ever seen.

Otherwise you'll become someone who becomes angry while playing rather than having fun and you'll do it while becoming racist against Russians & Spanish speaking people.

3746,Anonymous,01-Nov-13,0,"No communication, too many unfixed as well as unadressed bugs and a hats only policy justify this rating.Furthermore, the greedy actions of the company and the undesireable balance make this game a real joke and nothing but a waste of time. I highly suggest to play League of Legends or Heroes of Newerth instead."
3748,Anonymous,27-Oct-13,0,"Great pvp, with great champions. Great team play, game play. There's around 100 champions, for newbies, medium and advanced. If u don't know which champion is good for u just go single draft and i know that u will find something good. 10/10"
3749,Anonymous,17-Sep-13,0,one of the most boring games i ever played. honestly.also the online community consitsts of 99% garbage talking kids. not sure how anyone can spend more than 4 hours on this.better get warcraft 3 and the original dota mod.
3752,Anonymous,16-Sep-13,0,"I found this game to be to stale. It's just so difficult to enjoy when you have an hour of repetitive gameplay, really reminds me of D3 and that's supposed to be an insult. I noticed that the other players were very rude and hostile to beginners, and really made my experience even more negative."
3753,Anonymous,22-Aug-13,0,"been a fan of the game since warcraft days. Can't fault the game play at all. HOWEVER, it literally disconnects be at least 5 times a GAME.  There is NOTHING wrong with my internet nor am i running anything else. i know its free and all but this is TERRIBLE. I've stopped playing looking to start playing on League of Legends.what a let down, sort it our valve."
3754,Anonymous,12-Aug-13,0,I wouldn't mind this game if it wasn't for the community the first online game i played and this is day one i don't do too good not bad but not good and some guy just lays into me so want i'm not perfect at the start so i try again it gets worse and worse until i can't take it anymore.
