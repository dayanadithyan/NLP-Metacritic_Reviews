312,Anonymous,22-Jul-18,8,"I will ignore the community the game has overall, and i will focus on the game.League of Legends it's a pretty solid MOBA for the genre, tons of characters, different combinations, tons of posibilities, you will stick to what's recommended to do but when you are confident enough to play on your own, it's pretty fun overall but not the best."
315,Anonymous,18-Jul-18,0,I've never encountered so much negativity in other people. Developers doesn't seem to take any effort in managing it. Unplayable.
316,Anonymous,30-Jun-18,1,"Plz stop nerfing the op characters & also the weak ones, stop making me update for 1 new skin and some colour changes on the menu. Fix ur community first bcuz they r bad like ur game. If u have not nerfed teemo yet plz do. Blitzjrank too strong. Plz ban hackers PROPERLY. Game is pay to win by Skinz=Wins. Riot, with balancing like that you should go and work for Blizzard. Lots of love, Me"
317,Anonymous,24-Jun-18,0,worst game ever ....... most toxic community ever ...... how ppl still play this *****
322,Anonymous,05-Jun-18,6,"League of Legends(LOL) is one of the best MOBA in the world,  It offers a lot of champions, beautiful skin concept, graphics are great, each champion has an unique gameplay. Is a nice game to play with friends, but some players are so Toxic and some times Riot games creates unbalanced champions."
323,Anonymous,20-May-18,7,"it is my favourite competitive game, if i don't calificate ii with a  10, it is because it has the worst player comunity."
324,Anonymous,17-May-18,0,"This community is so bad. I played a lot with this, and i saw many players, who have to be at better rank, than mine, but when i'm the best in the team noone honored me."
325,Anonymous,13-May-18,1,Bad community. Ugly/outdated graphics. Oversimplistic UI. You need to pay to unlock champions. Avoid at all cost.
326,Anonymous,10-May-18,9,"I have played this game for nearly 100 hours and I love it. If you like MOBAs check it out! But mute everybody in the game, as the playerbase can be very toxic."
328,Anonymous,24-Apr-18,2,"1. No balance in normal games. One team can be x20 powerful than other one, so in the end (very fast end) nobody enjoyed the match. Worst part is Riot Games know about this problem but doing anything about it. 2. Toxic community (no idea why? Maybe because game is ""toxic"" as well?)"
332,Anonymous,06-Apr-18,9,This game in 8 years has very strongly changed to the best and continues to go in the same direction. I play very long and I am happy with everything
333,Anonymous,22-Mar-18,9,LoL is a great game with a great team development. They're always giving total suport for players. It's not perfect because there isn't a single mode.
334,Anonymous,16-Mar-18,0,Worst community in casual game! Some useless system in MOBA like buy new hero or tree of talant or rune.
336,Anonymous,19-Feb-18,0,"worst game ever...trollers,feeders,noobs in every single game,u cant do **** in ranked even if u play good every game,this game just suck,,,never start play this game"
337,Anonymous,06-Feb-18,7,"Ein sehr kompetetives Spiel, welches sehr hohen Wiederspielwert mitbringt. Jedoch gibt es einige bugs die meist zwar nicht spielentscheident sind aber einfach nerven. Des Weiteren sollte man sich bewusst sein dass wenn man keinen Helden spiel der zuzeit Meta ist sehr schwere Karten hat."
342,Anonymous,23-Dec-17,9,"Very fun and addictive game, but the community is SO toxic. It's a very good game."
343,Anonymous,11-Dec-17,10,"It is the most perfect game of MOBA genre. Gameplay, intuitiveness, esports are all excellent. It is hard to imagine how much users are playing this game. It also tells us that this game is great."
344,Anonymous,05-Dec-17,1,"The game is impossible to enjoy as a new player with the massive influx of smurf accounts from higher level players. Only a small fraction of the heroes are actually viable (the game has 130+ heroes, ofc it's not balanced). Overall it's just not fun, it's frustrating and does not lend itself to new players. I shouldn't have to spend 8 hours on youtube to play a video game lol."
346,Anonymous,28-Nov-17,7,Uno de los mejores juegos competitivos actuales sin duda alguna.Mueve grandes masas.Tecnicamente no es gran cosa pero ofrece mucha diversion y competitividad.Ideal para jugar con amigos.
347,Anonymous,28-Nov-17,0,League of legends isn't a bad game by any means. The reason I got such a strong opinion on it is because it got pay to progress faster. You can buy xp boosts. Enough said
353,Anonymous,21-Sep-17,0,"A good game, but a piece of crap community ,brazilian community is the worst of all, and the devs too.you loose acounts for doing nothing and being reported by kids"
354,Anonymous,14-Sep-17,0,Almost everything but the core gameplay is poor.  Riot is clearly milking this game for as much money as possible.Prepare for a toxic community and bugs galore.  This is a joke of a competitive game.
356,Anonymous,30-Jul-17,9,LoL is a great Moba which combines a simple gameplay with a variety of different champions and offers a breathtaking gaming experience.The Meta changes constantly and so there are times to strong things and too weak which sometimes makes it difficult for some Players.The only criticism would be the community
357,Anonymous,30-Jul-17,9,I think that this is truly a unique game and I would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then I think you should give this game a try.
359,Anonymous,30-Jun-17,4,"The best of the game is the chat after the games, it's hilarious.I got placed in bronze III in ranked, clearly the system is broken because I suck at this game."
364,Anonymous,04-May-17,0,"Why you must play rank with bad skill and stupid player? You wil never find interest in this game, test champions, AFK/quit, Tool/hack and too many thing is all about of negative in LoL."

371,Anonymous,03-Apr-17,3,"This is a dumb person's Dota-clone. Made for kids, by company that only cares about money.  It's a childish game, made by childish people, and will never be built in a good way."
372,Anonymous,26-Mar-17,0,"Overhyped MOBA, does not promote skill but rather picking the easy path with lock on skills that does not miss. Worst part about League of Legends is the community management - endless toxicity no matter what level of ranking you sit at, slow response to critical issues such as the Hydra crash and Blade of the Ruined King bug existed for YEARS before they were acknowledged and fixed."
375,Anonymous,07-Mar-17,4,"A boring and repetitive mess of a game, if you can call it a game. Just doesn't have the replay value to even become invested in it. Very little depth to the game play. Just boring and makes no new strides as MOBA."

383,Anonymous,11-Dec-16,9,"Far from perfection, i know, many many funy ways to play the game are simply blocked out by riot for no reason at all, but still, this game i play at least a match every single day for 6 years. That is very hard for any game to achieve."
386,Anonymous,30-Nov-16,8,"League of Legends as a game is fun, but its community is trash. Games are meant to be fun and the community doesn't reflect that. There are far too many people who blame others and lash out there frustration on them. It's a game for **** sake enjoy it."
390,Anonymous,10-Nov-16,8,"very nice game to spend many hours either alone or in company, closely followed by the developers with some updates though sometimes a bit too unbalanced. He recommended for person who likes to play as a team but with a lot of patience"
393,Anonymous,03-Nov-16,0,"Toxic community af. In every single match can find a guy who flame/troll or trying to f@ck up your game. In the beginning it was a good game but is just a ""poison"" for the gaming community,and the worst is that the riot is do nothing against these people."

401,Anonymous,10-Sep-16,9,"I started to play the game 4 years ago and I haven't stopped playing since. I love this game because it is a complex game that adjusts to your skill level.

420,Anonymous,21-May-16,8,"This is my most played/favorite game. It can be a bit frustrating sometimes, but I still enjoy playing it. The pro scene is amazing and I love watching it."
421,Anonymous,21-May-16,7,"Not the best MOBA ever, but has a few good characters. I do feel that it can be annoying playing the same map over and over again. Again like every other moba, this game has a toxic community. It just seems to come with the genre and maybe from the latest generation of gamers."
422,Anonymous,01-May-16,10,"Easily one of my favorite games ever. Basically every 40 minutes being thrown into a competitive game, then refreshing and doing it again is very fun and refreshing."

430,Anonymous,16-Apr-16,1,"If your gonna have a MOBA with over 100 characters to play atleast try to balance them out. Its pathetic how some champions are just dead due to the fact that the kits they have are ""Not for the current meta"". Riot should have stopped in 2013."
431,Anonymous,08-Apr-16,9,I have been playing league for some time now and i love it and i hate it! it a really fun game to play but only when i am playing a group with friends
432,Anonymous,05-Apr-16,5,"League of Legends is an okay-ish RTS game, especially for those new in the genre. It's just that there ain't too much of a difference between characters, play styles, effects, buffs, skills, and whatnot. I find it having a significant lack of ""variety"" between its game play elements."
433,Anonymous,01-Apr-16,4,"This game was fun when it launched but not now. Heroes are mostly rip-off from DotA, making it looks like an alternative version of it which made for kids. It's hard to find an adult who treats you like a real human and talks with you without using any insulting word, community is pretty bad. Nevertheless, it's sad to see that a game like League of Legends wasted its potential."
435,Anonymous,25-Mar-16,0,The community is not good... it's a good concept but i hate this game because of this COMMUNITY TOO MUCH NOOBS AND TOXI. ranked are worst everybody is toxic

438,Anonymous,11-Mar-16,0,"Have played this game for four fxxxing years. I feel so bad about this game. No improve for the sxxtty client, no clan system, no banning system. If you get a troll, you will suffer for freaking 30-40 mins. Don't play it, if you are worried about your health. This game will give you cancer."
442,Anonymous,24-Feb-16,6,"When you first start out, it becomes really addicting but this game involves a lot of grinding for IP (in-game currency). Took me a about month to get a certain amount of IP to get the champion I wanted. Grinding so much really took the fun out of playing it. But it is certainly a better experience with 4-5 friends. Also, too many OP Champions and a lot of balancing issues."
444,Anonymous,11-Feb-16,7,"Fun, addictive , quite content to which you will have enough hours , promotes competitiveness and encourages decision-making satisfactory experience ... but empty, it's a shame it as Flapibird , really missing the story , he produced no innovation and toxic community detracts many points."

473,Anonymous,05-Nov-15,8,I love League of Legends and i've been playing it for a while. I dont give it a 10 because the community do not deserve it. Too much rage which is hard to ignore sometimes. Apart from that its amazing what you can do there. So many things to learn and to improve.
475,Anonymous,18-Oct-15,0,"The community is horrible, expect to lose your sanity as every game, there are 9 other kids who want to **** your mother.

477,Anonymous,16-Oct-15,9,"I've played hundreds of hours of this game and there's always some new nuance to learn and explore, plus it's mad fun to watch. This is the game I come back to when there's nothing good out."

481,Anonymous,10-Sep-15,0,"I played 1 game in Casual as Ashe. Everyone blamed me for losing just because I was playing Ashe. The game in itself is not that bad ,but the community just kills it ,and drives you away. I did play 1 game in Ranked once I was able to from playing VS AI ,and DAMN the community is just toxic. The entire team was just fighting. I mean ,that's just ,annoying ,and unfriendly."
482,Anonymous,09-Sep-15,4,Just hate LoL i know it's one of the most popular games and most guys play it because of the multiplayer but i hate it. I tried to play it but i'm very bad at it. Just hate it. I give it 4 only for the beatiful environment of the game.
487,Anonymous,04-Aug-15,1,They couldn't build this game with balance that is why they are nerfing and buffing heroes all the time and the graphics when there is a game like Dota 2 why do you even bother to play this.

491,Anonymous,02-Jul-15,0,just a really bad game with a really bad community behind a really bad company. not much to say here. Riot just wants your money so they keep creating really unoriginal content to get you to purchase RP.

503,Anonymous,01-May-15,6,"One of the most fun MOBA games I have ever played! Tons of Champion, unique Skins and Abilities. The champion Lore is really cool also. Riot games have done an amazing job with this game. They always impress me with the new skins and gamemode they release! The only bad thing about this game is the community and how TOXIC some people can be. (Overall: 7/10)"
505,Anonymous,29-Apr-15,0,"One of the most overrated games, by far. Quite possibly the least fun game there is, and one of the worst.First off, the community is TERRIBLE. Since it's an online game the community is a huge part of it, but God, it's bad.Gameplay. The game's target audience is autistic nerds with triple glasses that can't have fun because the adrenaline rush might kill them. That's how fun it is."

526,Anonymous,29-Jan-15,9,nine because the game is fun and addicting with many strategies you can make and champions have different skill sets. not 10 because they need to solve the lag in the game. ty
528,Anonymous,25-Jan-15,0,"They made copy cat. World of warcraft rogue, warrioir gage. and stats. Absolutely same. And Dota style. I think that originality is very important to review."
532,Anonymous,11-Jan-15,0,"Awful game. Repetitive gameplay, totally unbalanced champions, only one real map. I know people are saying this game is funny with friend but they should probably play better game which are funniest like Awesomenauts. The ""Hardcore gamers"" shoulden't loose their time on this and probably should go play Dota 2"
533,Anonymous,07-Jan-15,0,"Worst community i've ever seen in a Game. It becomes unplayable, specially in Brazil, where 90% of players start calling your mother something before the match even starts. Listen to me, it's not worth playing, you are only going to screw the rest of your day."
537,Anonymous,02-Jan-15,7,"The game was executed quite well, and there are many who love it. But personally I really don't enjoy it.There are loads of negative and annoying factors in this game. Like being forced to last hit all minions or just go **** youself because you just lost. Only some characters being viable, while others are just absolutely useless. And way more.So all I can give this game is a 7."
538,Anonymous,27-Dec-14,10,"I play this game now for a long time and it is still  the best online games i've ever played, and I'm sure that I will play this game for the next 5 years"

543,Anonymous,21-Dec-14,9,"Being the only game i play, also a  (team based) PvP and forgivable Free-to-Play approach will easily hook you on hours upon hours. With a massive selection of characters with different abilities and roles, gives you many options. However it has a unforgivable player-base that every game has due to the horrible mentality our society has. Anyway it's worth checking out"
544,Anonymous,18-Dec-14,2,I've played this game and i hated it it is always the same thing you click to attack press a button on you're keyboard for magic and that's it. I expected a good game with action. Everyone likes games with chaos.
548,Anonymous,10-Dec-14,10,"It's a great game , no need to pay to win. Always updates , champions and championships.Only thing is paid skins to beautify the champions .All F2P games should follow the model of the League of Legends"

554,Anonymous,28-Nov-14,5,"There are many Pro and Cons, the main ones:Game is fun with friends playing causally. If you play solo prepare to get disappointed/frustrated as there are many trolls/team griefers. Ranked is very competitive and often the playerbase is very toxic and abusive to bad performances. The graphic just got updated so it's pretty nice. Lots of new updates/Champions to keep the game fresh."
557,Anonymous,16-Nov-14,3,"I guess it's alright for a free game, and some people like it, but if you're anything like me, you'll hate it. Repetitive, unbalanced, **** controls and essentially pay-to-win mechanics make this game pretty crap."
561,Anonymous,04-Nov-14,10,"This is one of the best games I've ever played in my entire 30 year gaming life. It's a action/shooter/strategic multiplayer-mixed-genre game. I've played LOL 4 years since it launced 2011. I'm not interested in the rift anymore. but, I still play the abyss somtimes. Again, LOL is the one of the best game for the entire gaming history like WOW, COD4."
565,Anonymous,23-Oct-14,10,"This game is an excellent game. If you're interested in getting better perhaps you should check out Challenger Support player Benign Sentinel's stream. He's extremely helpful, knowledgeable and positive with a wide range of characters. Check out his stream at www.twitch.tv/eroticles"
566,Anonymous,23-Oct-14,9,"League is the best free to play MOBA out there. Developer Riot continues to patch, upgrade and surprise their players. A lot of game modes and a constant flow of new characters and skins make this a game to be played for years to come."
568,Anonymous,21-Oct-14,10,"I've played very close to 1100 hours of this game by now, and that number is only going up. You'll only ever know you enjoy it if you play it and try for yourself. For me, that absurd amount of time should speak for itself."
570,Anonymous,13-Oct-14,9,"I'm playing this game for 4 years now, starting early season 1 and all I can say is that this is an amazing game with a horrible community, but all you have to do is to find 4 friends to play and mute the other team and this is certainly my most important pvp experience I ever found in an online game."

578,Anonymous,25-Sep-14,2,It can be fun... but i find this one very childish... like little cartoons. I rather play Smite. In this game you can find ragers like in every other game...
579,Anonymous,22-Sep-14,0,"This third-person shooter is even worse than the Defense of the Ancients map on Warcraft III, and I never liked D.O.T.A. at all. This is an awful game played by many pretentious dirtbags."
581,Anonymous,20-Sep-14,6,"One thing I like about the League, is that it has a clear, fluid gameplay, unlike some of the other MOBA I've tried. It's nothing special, but good enough to kill some time."
583,Anonymous,16-Sep-14,5,"Not a bad game, but it doesn't mean that is a really good game.This is a MOBA arcade fire-like, unfair system and expensive stuff (you can buy with points of the game but the game obey you play more and more to get that points, you can also get points with real money), has a cartooned kids style and the people love this game beacause is fun, but not for me."
585,Anonymous,09-Sep-14,8,League of Legends has been the most popular MOBA game for the past four or five years. I don't really need to praise it.It does have some issues. The main one being that new players don't have access to a large champion pool or runes that veterans might have.
587,Anonymous,09-Sep-14,7,"Let's be honest, part of the hate against the game seems to be backed by the fact that many do not know how to build their champions and misunderstand the basic dynamics of the game expecting a non MOBA experience. Hence the distaste towards the game. Its a decent at best good experience."
597,Anonymous,11-Aug-14,10,"Constantly being developed, balanced and are very dedicated to their community, this game is not for those who are rubbish, it takes lots of time to adjust to. REMEMBER DO NOT RATE THE GAME BASED ON IT'S HORRIBLE TOXIC COMMUNITY IN LOWER LEVELS, THAT IS NOT LEAGUES FAULT!"
605,Anonymous,20-Jul-14,10,"As a game, this is near perfect for me. The playerbase is at times extremely hostile, but the game itself is very good. This is one of the best games to play with friends."
607,Anonymous,17-Jul-14,9,The game is a lot of fun and super addictive. The game is now super vast with over 100 different characters to play as. Riot continues to update and revise the game frequently especially when one of the characters is over powered.The game is great and really competitive (its also free) so why not try it out?
610,Anonymous,12-Jul-14,10,"This game contains more than a hundred different heroes, 4 very different maps and a horrible community. The game itself is amazing. It's really well made and the champions are unique and most of them are fun to play. The only problem with this game is that most players act like retards. But as long as you just mute the scumbags you will love it."
612,Anonymous,10-Jul-14,0,Really boring and easy game.I can't enjoy this brat game LoL.Heroes are too artificial.Too many heroes appear in this game and hero picks are really hard.Worst MOBA ever.
614,Anonymous,07-Jul-14,0,"Its hit the point of DDoS or 9 of 10 people trolling that this game is virtually unplayable.I have been playing since this game was in beta and for a long while this game was great, now it is just terrible to play with. Riot cares little of the players and only of their ""balance"" that generally breaks the game as opposed to fixing it.. Dont waste your time."
620,Anonymous,05-Jul-14,0,"Outstanding Potential, but then the line of success was broken by the community. Everything is the communities' fault, as well as unbalanced teams, and not to mention, why should you have to win so many matches to rank up? That's like if you were on a tightrope from France to New York, I'm DEAD serious.RIP"
621,Anonymous,30-Jun-14,0,"Absolutely fantastic game ruined by the community.  So many toxic players and trolls, its unbelievable.  The ranking system is an absolute joke and does not reward players for skill, but rather luck.  Find something else to play.  I would give the game an 8 or 9 rating, but can't with due to the community.  It is horrible and completely ruins the experience."
622,Anonymous,29-Jun-14,10,"I play this game for almost 3 years. One of best games i ever played. And I cant belive how someone could actualy hate on one of best games ever. Realy, I wonder where all those objective reviews comes from ..."
624,Anonymous,23-Jun-14,3,Garbage Game for Brain-dead Children. There's a reason why Pewdiepie is the most popular channel on YouTube and League of Legends is the most popular game. People are idiots and the masses like terrible things.
625,Anonymous,20-Jun-14,0,"Really, what is this game about? Where is the fun? Why is this crap so popular? The battles are very boring and can last even for 1 hour. Sometimes the battles finish very early, because the game lets the noob players play in your team and makes you mad. I can't believe that millions of people are addicted to this crap, that it has the same fun like Microsoft PowerPoint... -_-"
626,Anonymous,16-Jun-14,9,"I love this game, although i wouldn't agree its for everyone. People complain about balancing problems, but riot is constantly fixing and updating them, they do listen to the community. If you've seen any tournaments you would realize this is a very competitive and enjoyable game."
629,Anonymous,08-Jun-14,1,After playing this game since the end of Season 2 and all the way till the summer of Season 4. I have not found a more stressful and toxic game in my life and on top of that the game's servers lag all the time. You're better off staying away from this growing fad called MOBA games. If you really have to play a moba play Dota 2 at least they know how to manage and run a game.

Top score; 7-6 score: great but not one of the best; 5-below score: serious flaws.===========I hate the camera pan and no real autoattack. Diverse hero pool is diverse which is good.

643,Anonymous,28-Apr-14,6,I have played this a good amount and thinks its a pretty good game. Tho i have switched to Dota 2 because i find it better. It still play LoL sometimes but not as much as Dota 2.
644,Anonymous,26-Apr-14,7,"This game is a lot of fun and addicting. I've spent many hours in it. Its hampered by a really crappy community and a terrible game client. For free, however, I can't complain. I bought some characters but haven't spent more than $20 I'd say. And for that price, I definitely got my money's worth."
646,Anonymous,24-Apr-14,5,"I've been a fan of this game since I started playing back in 2011. It didn't take long though for me to to grow tired of the horribly toxic community. The game plays well, the roster is nice but the community alone is more than enough to cause me not to play (unless I can get 4 friends). 4 friends playing? I'd throw it up to a 7 or 8. Playing solo? I'd rather chew aluminum foil."
647,Anonymous,22-Apr-14,0,"Poorly balanced, old graphics, rather boring, toxic community, and developers who don't care about the game, but rather about just making as much money as possible on it. Avoid at all costs. Play Dota 2, or any other Moba."
649,Anonymous,19-Apr-14,3,"Great game but the community destroys it... with no working punishment systems in place, players troll as a sport ruining the game for any and all. Does not welcome new players whatsoever. Extremely hateful player base."
651,Anonymous,10-Apr-14,4,"Some friends posted about this on Facebook, so I decided to to download it.Its not terrible but I just can't get into it no matter how much I try. Maybe I'm just spoiled by the many other much, much better games out there..."
654,Anonymous,03-Apr-14,0,"A pay to win oriented game, as runes give so much more early game advantage, not to mention the expanded champion pool.And plainly, the anti-competitive attitude by the developer makes me sick."
657,Anonymous,27-Mar-14,0,Stupid game circles map.Abominable press play.This seems to mimic the characters somewhere.Riot foam company that came up overnight.Game industry's disaster.
658,Anonymous,26-Mar-14,4,Its fine copy of DotA but nothing more. Popularize MOBA genre but this is just not bad game.+ Community is full of annoying kids so this game is unplayable without someone to party.
664,Anonymous,08-Mar-14,10,I played League of Legends for a while and never stopped! This awesome game is addictive and is surelyone of the best free downloadable games I've ever played!
665,Anonymous,01-Mar-14,0,They have the worst matchmaking. I can't believe any company would do such a big mistake to allow duo q option into a solo competitive mode. I'm talking about their ranked matchmaking. It sucks so much when you see high elo people carrying low elo friends through duo q.. ruining the fun for everyone.
671,Anonymous,12-Feb-14,6,"The game itself isn't bad at all, it's actually very fun. However, the community that ruins it completely. Seriously. It makes the game unplayable!!!!"
673,Anonymous,05-Feb-14,9,"Not many possible spells to cast, is much more fun when playing with friends. All around a great game that challenges the summoner to gear the champion and use strategic spell combinations in order to survive."
674,Anonymous,04-Feb-14,10,"Very enjoyable game. I spend hours playing this game every week. Excellent gameplay. The free-to-play model work fine, as no real money is needed to fully play this game. The ranked game allow to keep a goal even after hitting level 30. Riot put a lot of effort improving the community interaction with the tribunal."
675,Anonymous,04-Feb-14,0,"Many bugs , Server unstable , Horrible community ,... Only good to have fun with friends other wise forget it ! Then it is a copy of dota where Riot added a way to make money : Lock champions which i stupid but well...At least the game is not balanced at all, you will understand if you play against a Katarina ...."
677,Anonymous,21-Jan-14,10,"Always changing environment of people characters and new game modes. Great community of youtube streamers and helpful forums. able to be run on most any computer. Fun multiplayer, or  solo que modes."
678,Anonymous,11-Jan-14,2,"A cheap 3D remake of Pokemon from GameBoy Color. No actual skill required for playing, just choose the strongest hero. There are many games in this genre that are much better. Have seen worse games though."
679,Anonymous,04-Jan-14,10,I would highly recommend this highly popular moba that is driving forward the genre overall not Dota 2. The game is fun to play with friends and is a blast if you decide to play it competitively thanks to ranked que. Yes the games community can be frustrating but that is not from the games fault.  The amount of hours I have played on this game is insane and the best thing? Its free!
680,Anonymous,02-Jan-14,10,awesome made game...nice graphics and not too much requirements i give 10 because i like it DOTA is nothing compared with this so i recomend this in order  to enjoy playing some MOBA games
681,Anonymous,01-Jan-14,5,A very good game with good mechanics and very good carater design !But totaly ruined by the pathetic servers ever full and with lags or just crash !Do not give money  You will regret it  like me ...Simply play for free 
682,Anonymous,01-Jan-14,8,The game is pretty good but it has a terrible community. Every step you meet a flamer. The graphics are a bit childish. I admire Riot Games for the fact that with the number of characters they managed to keep the balance. Of course there are bugs but the MOBA game does not? Overall I would recommend and I wish you well for the future.
686,Anonymous,29-Dec-13,10,"Great game, not p2w nor as easy as same others say. The recent changes to the meta just made it better so that even supporting can net you a lot of gold."

691,Anonymous,25-Dec-13,1,This game is fun but the community is just bad and you have to pay money to buy all the champions unlike Dota which cost 60 bucks  you don't have to pay anymore but for League Of Legends I spend about 200 bucks and I still don't have all the champs. I would just stay away from this game!!

702,Anonymous,13-Dec-13,0,"This 16-bit copy of DotA is awful, unplayable thing! It was made for donate and making it popular by advertising it. It's very slow and too easy to be eSports! I can't even give it 1 point of score!"
704,Anonymous,09-Dec-13,0,"Definetly not the best of games out there today ,cant complain to much about them graphics as I enjoy alot of older games with even worse graphics but some heroes are overpowered and this is like a BAD dota 2 copy. Its a game idea stolen from Blizzard and Blizzards alternative is more fun and better game."
705,Anonymous,08-Dec-13,0,"This game is really fun for little kids, aged 12 and under. This game is very boring and holds your hand all the way. You wont feel the excitment while playing. There is no challenge!"
709,Anonymous,29-Nov-13,0,I tried picking up the game multiple times with my buddies but we always lose interest.  Like many other moba's  the community is atrocious.  For people new to the game League of legends is essentially a pay to win game.  Graphics wise things looks great and the game would attract a much more diverse demographic if they get rid of the majority of NSFW aspects of the game.
714,Anonymous,21-Nov-13,10,Minecraft is one of the most revolutionary games out there. The open worlds are AMAZING. There is so much to do now with 1.7 just came out. It is so worth the cash. Go get it now.
715,Anonymous,20-Nov-13,10,"I've been playing this game for almost 3 years and it is just getting better each time. New champions every month and repairing bugs and changing things to make the game more balanced. Huge community, very accessible game and the tec need for this game are few, so you can play it anywhere. Excellent game."
717,Anonymous,19-Nov-13,0,"Welcome to Eu servers then you able to play 5 min of 25 min game and other time just froze. It is completely ruins game expirience. So if you want to play it, try US servers at least, or better just not even play this "
722,Anonymous,17-Nov-13,7,"Fun game but slightly spoiled by the communi. Even in non ranked games theres way top much pressure that when you get a bad match, others will really make you feel like rubbish. I'd recommend playing with a group of friends though so you can enjoy the awesome game"
723,Anonymous,17-Nov-13,1,"I have played both League of Legends, and Dota 2. They have similar ""plots,"" and the gameplay is very similar, but I believe Dota 2 to be superior in nearly every way; the graphics, soounds, character diversity, etc. There too much going on at any time in LoL for me to really like how it looks."
726,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,0,"Good for newbies and kids, but not really interesting if you're looking for a quality game to spend you time on. If you like MOBA games, perhaps you should avoid this shallow rip-off and look elsewhere."
727,Anonymous,14-Nov-13,0,"I can not understand how you would want to play a game that has NO free heros, but simply has a few that rotate and you can not get your own without paying money. ""free to play"" my butt."
731,Anonymous,12-Nov-13,0,"This game is bad in every way. Crumby graphics, bad programming and a greedy company abusing the ""Pay to Win"" BS. Blizzard is making a MOBA: Heroes of the Storm. For the sake of all us MOBA and Dota fans I hope they are the first one's to do the genre some ""right""."
732,Anonymous,12-Nov-13,0,"not so bad casual game but donkey  competitive, Not for hardcore playersThe mother of this genre is DotA from Warcraft III, If you want to experience the true game of this genre play Dota 2"
733,Anonymous,11-Nov-13,0,"That was complete garbage. I downloaded after playing dota 2 for awhile and wanted to try out another one of these games, turns out you can only pick from 10 characters while others can pick from every character, that is funny. The picking stage is vital to moba games and not having every character is pointless."
734,Anonymous,11-Nov-13,7,Fun to play but to many champions to choose from and it's hard to figure out which is your best also has server lag spikes which get annoying after a while. Overall A great free to play game.
737,Anonymous,11-Nov-13,10,"LoL still remains as one of the most enjoyable team-playing experiences, especially if you find your own friends to play with. The community itself can be sub-par at times, but the MOBA experience is still well-designed, and Riot is responsive to the community's demands."
738,Anonymous,11-Nov-13,4,"Pros  Easy to play for newbie  especially young players, constantly update every 2 weeks.Cons  Bad graphics, Imbalance hero pool, Bad community, Too easy for veterans, "
740,Anonymous,11-Nov-13,6,"LOL can be entertaining.  Biggest complaint from me is the inability to play any hero from the start.  You need to pay for heroes or play a lot of games for points to unlock them.  This will require a lot of time.  There are also full skins that are obtained by paying.  Learning curve is smaller than Dota 2, but feel that Dota 2 is more entertaining to play and to watch."
741,Anonymous,11-Nov-13,0,Wow this game sucks hard first time playing and you got owned so hard the community was so harsh gameplay was bad and full of bugs the graphics are looking childish and low poly
742,Anonymous,10-Nov-13,7,the character roster is large and fairly balanced unlike a few years ago this was my first MOBA and i still play it has a big E-sport following and is great fun to play....with friends the community is fairly toxic unfortunately and i play on the EU W servers which break at least once a week
743,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,0,"basically a  game ,bad game play,bad graphcis ,evil developers ,and a comunity full of 12 age kids ,its a game pay2win because you must use money to get the good heroes"
744,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,0,"This game is very out dated, the graphics are hard to look at it just takes away from the overall game and the way they force you to buy characters makes this more of a pay to win game."
745,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,4,So unbalanced and so colorful that hurt my eyes and the community is also as bad as well. I don't really know how Riot could copy DotA (that is amazing) and do such a game. I would say DotA is three times better than LOL. Cyka.
746,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,0,"The graphic sucks RLY hard, its imbalanced u get bashed by nearly EVERYTHING in the game, the comm is AWFUL everybody is flaming u and insulting u like little childs"
747,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,0,"Awful business model compared to it's main competitor. You have to pay for or grind champions to play with. Aesthetic is not that different from the game which inspired it  DOTA, despite being the newer game. Community is horrible, which I guess comes with the territory  game is very linear and imbalanced. Not my cup of tea."
748,Anonymous,09-Nov-13,1,League of Legends is quite a funny game but there are better games in its genre. Also their F2P system is quite horrible... It's true that it not a Pay2Win system but still they should let you play all the heroes from the beginning. The game is imbalanced and made for kids or casual gamers.
750,Anonymous,08-Nov-13,0,"Really flat game, lowskillcap as  Pay 2 win, and really really unbalanced because the devs wants to sell their last released overpowered character. Servers are really bad, the game crash a lot. Have the worst toxic community of the entire gaming world."

It is terrible that you have to pay for the heros that are actually worth playing, how hardcore everyone is, and how difficult it is to understand what's going on.The game has plenty of action in the pro scene, but it's not exciting and gets tired after awhile.In conclusion, a pretty bad game."
756,Anonymous,05-Nov-13,0,"not fun at all just boring a plain copy of dota and the game has the worst community, 0/10 would not play even if I got paid too, with plenty of lag and bad graphics 0/10 would not play"
757,Anonymous,04-Nov-13,7,"The game is great but unfortunately, heavily burdened by its awful community which has legitimately ruined the experience for me. Each champions mechanics feel unique to them and it would be a great experience if it was possible to integrate something to allow the users the ability to never have to hear what anyone has to say besides in game instructions or something like that."
759,Anonymous,03-Nov-13,0,"I can't believe i've played this game. It' was awful. Gameplay imbalance, depressed graphic, easy combat and i think it is just a pile of rubbish. When you play this game you feel nothing but waste your time. Bottom line is this is just a cheap copy of DotA"

You can only use a few of the characters and they all change every week  and if you want to keep using one, you got  to BUY it, with either IP, awarded from playing, or using real money to buy them. To me, that is a huge turn-off, and it is definitely not ""free"""

773,Anonymous,27-Oct-13,5,"In its early days, League of Legends was great. However, that time has come and gone. the game has extreme balancing issues, sub-par graphics, poor character designs, and the worst community I have seen in a game in a very long time. I would suggest avoiding this game, as it has little to no shining qualities, and would only appeal to long-time fans of the genre."
779,Anonymous,14-Oct-13,0,"Very easy, does not offer challenges for those who usually play games of this genre. There is no strategy. The roles are completely static. It's imbalanced. The servers do not seem to have a good structure. Graphics overtaken.There are other better games"
780,Anonymous,13-Oct-13,7,TO ALL LOL players  LOL is a fun game to play and i sure would play it everyday if there wasn't dota 2 i sincerly advice you to quit this moba war of  and try both. personally i like dota 2 more it's deeper and harder than LOL but sometimes i got sick of russians so i play couple of LOL games
781,Anonymous,12-Oct-13,6,"fun game if you can stand the god awful fan base and the whiny kids that think every champion they cant kill on there first try is ""over powered"", dont play this game if you arent ready to play with some of the rudest wannabes youve ever met."

794,Anonymous,12-Sep-13,4,League of legends was a game made by riot games is a strategy game with a variety of characters to play.In 1 year the game had a lot of fans.Unfortunately the game is not so good.With the worst graphics ever.Fortunately the moves of the heroes are very good.The game has no story and its gameplay sucks. In a nutshell the game is boring.
799,Anonymous,08-Sep-13,10,"This game is really good. Sure, it has a steep learning curve, but even if you have little or no experience, it's worth a try! This game is completely free-to-play, with cosmetic ""skins"" for champions."
803,Anonymous,01-Sep-13,4,"To say honestly, Lol is really easy game, with worst MOBA community. Graphic is old, and don't fit me. People are vulgar, and unfriendly. Pay to Win system ruins everything. 25% of champions are overpowered (and expensive), and 75% are weak. Altough, game is playable, and when you spend there a lot of money, it will give you fun."
804,Anonymous,28-Aug-13,4,"It is a solid game, but is really overrated. Unfortunately it has the worst community of online games I have ever seen, which really drags the game down. Overall its fun for a free product, but it gets repetitive after a while."
806,Anonymous,24-Aug-13,0,its a pay to win game that has no thought on having any learning curve that rewords players who spend time on the game and not all the people are free witch messes up the flow win a new broken person comes out and the people who don't spend money ion the person get screwed over.
808,Anonymous,20-Aug-13,1,"Bad mannered replica. Very simplified game. Although it might be an opener to MOBA world for new players. If you want to know more see this awesome video ""review"" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRYOVlFSv_Q"
811,Anonymous,12-Aug-13,0,"Ugly, outdated, horrible community, RIOTs record of releasing OP champs and nerfing them after enough ppl buys them, artstyle really not my coup of tea its like playing pokemons which i suppose is a good think since its aimed for 12yo kids with parents credit card..."
813,Anonymous,06-Aug-13,0,"Bad game, bad hero copy paste to this game from the original dota, no denying, no stacks on neutrals, no denying towers or allies this is just a game for kids who cant take the dota learning curve"
814,Anonymous,05-Aug-13,0,Dota 2 is much competitve and fun to play .Tough to learn but better than this  Honestly its horrible and awful. Imbalanced and that runes and stuff with real money makes you stronger  Thats just pay to win.
815,Anonymous,04-Aug-13,10,"Love the game. Best MOBA out there, the only negative is the community, but all online games are going that way. No other game leads the Esports scene as much as LoL. Look forward to seeing you on SR. Giving it a 10(would be a 9) because of all the troll 0 and 2's."
816,Anonymous,02-Aug-13,0,"This game is flat out awful. It's imbalanced, has horribly graphics, frequent lag and server downtime, and the developers don't seem to care about their game in general. Stay well clear of this one. BAD GAME BAD GAME...... REALLY BAD COPY FOR DOTA :S"
817,Anonymous,01-Aug-13,2,"funny at first, but quickly becomes bad because of updates, up and nerf, poor community  in 2013 it is still a beta game.Be care it's a Pay 2 Win, not F2P ^^"
819,Anonymous,31-Jul-13,10,I guarantee this game is voted 10 or 1 depending on who plays what game. It's a fantastic game available for free. Sure it has it's downfalls but in my opinion it is a very well made game with a great community behind the scenes. The ties with professional gaming make it even more enthralling.
828,Anonymous,28-Jul-13,2,Pros:- Easy to learn- Fast matchmaking- Have other maps- Easier to earn gold in-game- Spammable skillsCons:- Bad Graphics- Sound quality is kinda bad for me- Unbalanced- Limited champs to choose from- Lesser strategies- Game play is just same every game- Pay to win
829,Anonymous,27-Jul-13,0,"It's basically ""baby's first moba"" it takes really no skill to play and it's just an all around casual-fest for players with less skill but want to pretend they're good by playing any number of riot's broken champions. It's a really bad game it's only fun if you're completely new to the moba scene and have no idea what you're doing. If you lack skill in spades this is the game to play."
831,Anonymous,26-Jul-13,0,"Bad game, bad hero copy paste to this game from the original dota, no denying, no stacks on neutrals, no denying towers or allies this is just a game for kids who cant take the dota learning curve."
832,Anonymous,26-Jul-13,10,"This game deserves at least an 8/10. The user score is so low because when the game came out, it wasn't the best game but now the quality is very good. The game is more balanced than it used to be and riot has made league of legends into a beast. I am giving 10/10 to bump the user score but the game is nowhere near perfect."
840,Anonymous,20-Jul-13,7,"Fun and decent game overall, although it is plagued with poor balancing,  graphics, and toxic community.The League client is also extremely buggy and unresponsive. Overall doesn't feel like a high budget game."
842,Anonymous,20-Jul-13,0,I can recommend you this game with my whole heart if you are below the gae of 12 and are looking for cartoon-ish characters to spend your time. The community is horrible from what I can tell. I managed to play 100 games with a thick skin but I cannot take it anymore.
843,Anonymous,19-Jul-13,1,Low quality graphics and unbalanced heroes are the immediately apparent shortfalls of this game. Then comes the limited hero roster and grinding that is required to unlock the full game. Another unappealing aspect is that you can use real life money to grant your hero buffs which means a game can start off unfair.
845,Anonymous,18-Jul-13,0,"This game is really bad. I lost my time downloading it, and trying to play. Doesn't worth the name it has. You should think about having a Super Nintendo before downloading it"
851,Anonymous,16-Jul-13,1,Pros:- good overall game concept- easy to learnCons:- many imbalances- immature player base- shallow and not that complex game mechanics and strategies- very bad graphics
852,Anonymous,16-Jul-13,0,"Bad Free to Play Model;Bad Rune system, makes you need to play for months before you can go to Ranked games;Bad Community;TOTALLY imbalanced...Riot is one of the WORSE...Just go to Dota 2 and Valve..."
855,Anonymous,13-Jul-13,9,"This free game its very very fun if you play with another 4 friends, the problems are many factors about the server, the trolls, afk, racist players etc. And the worst its the tribunal who cant punish better to these people"
857,Anonymous,07-Jul-13,0,"I'll put it short, this game is awful.  I got bored within the first 5 minutes, then in another 5 minutes I get frustrated from the awful learning curve this game has.  If you have played MOBA games before, then you may be at home.  Otherwise, proceed with caution, and keep a grasp on your sanity. (I played with Bots, so I'd hate to play this with other people.)"
863,Anonymous,05-Jun-13,10,Its a good free to play MOBA game. A lot of moba out there is free  but this one is unique on its own way. It has a cartoonie graphic that makes it unique and fun to play. They update the game pretty frequently too. A very fun game to play. Its worth tryng
864,Anonymous,03-Jun-13,10,"League of Legends is certainly one of the best games i have ever played. I love everything about the game and its so fun to play the game. Certainly play this game, i recommend it to everyone!!!"
866,Anonymous,30-May-13,6,"This game has the worst community on earth (except for Call of Duty). Due to a lot of unbalanced champions and unbalanced IP/RP costs this game would score low but the multiplayer feature is amazing. Great game to play with your friends but remember, solo queue is hell on earth."
867,Anonymous,30-May-13,8,Quite addicting moba game  5/10 when playing alone  8 /10 with friends   Game is overall quite well balanced   patches are coming out quite good pace   Free to play with no pay to win things 
868,Anonymous,28-May-13,0,"'Free to play' is attractive, but this is not fun. Honestly, I do not know why. When I play this game, I feel so boring. Free, but do not want to. [Waste of time]"
869,Anonymous,24-May-13,7,"Will blow you away with its awesome game-play,but as well cartoonish graphics.An awesome MOBA game,but yet the graphics seem to be a bit dated for its release date,but that doesn't matter at all,does it?In addition,the community of the game will rage at you most of the time in the game-play,but this is the game someone could easily get in love with."
871,Anonymous,17-May-13,0,"Beautiful game, not based on buy to play, good graphics compared to LOL, its very simple, fast and short game,is made for anyone who wants to play a good game without paying a weight which I think is perfect for me, perfect for you"
873,Anonymous,16-May-13,0,"Worst game ever.The game itself is fun, but the client crashes, nerfing of champions, terrible ranked system, horrible xp/.ip earning, bad community, static gameplay and terrible support means that you should avoid this. And the worst thing of course is Riot itself, which should get an award for the worst company."
875,Anonymous,04-May-13,10,"This is honestly one of the most addicting games I have ever played, its free, not pay to win, and is very intense. I'm surprised how many people are complaining about the graphics, they aren't half bad, and as long as a game is great, graphics shouldn't make any difference at all."
880,Anonymous,29-Apr-13,2,"Fun game, however the lag has became unbearable after a recent patch. Too bad the developers decided it's fine to leave it alone and let players deal with it"
886,Anonymous,15-Apr-13,0,Worst community ever.
888,Anonymous,14-Apr-13,10,"I have played this game for a little over two years and I see no sign of stopping anytime soon. This game is so terribly hard to get into, but once you become familiar with the mechanics, you will love the MOBA franchise forever. +1 with friends. -1 for community. +1 for esports. -1 for teemo."
903,Anonymous,27-Jan-13,0,"The game is so horribly written, the game client is constantly crashing, it takes you forever to find a game. Then when you do get in a game it's actually not very fun."
906,Anonymous,20-Jan-13,6,"It's a pretty nice and easy introduction to the MOBA genre, much easier than the other options on the market and free if you choose to not  get skins. However,  the community is horrible and the client is hopelessly outdated. Each game  lasts quite long and is very monotonous however. It's hard to  play more than 1 or 2 games in a row."
908,Anonymous,16-Jan-13,8,"I have been playing this game for nearly a year now. I would say this game is brilliant and successful. They have over 120 champions from which to choose. Each player begins at opposing sides of a map in an area called the Spawning Pool, near what is called a Nexus. To win the match is depend on if  your team can destroy the nexus first. The maximum champion"
915,Anonymous,04-Jan-13,8,8/10 This is probably one of the funnest Computer games ive ever played. I love the game itself the idea. the characters. The skins..Everything. The only reason i took away 2 ratings is because of the community. IF you want 12 Year old trolling little kids bothering you all day thats the only issue with this game.
917,Anonymous,28-Dec-12,2,Really dumb game. I can't believe its so popular. You hardly do anything at all its incredibly simple and uncomplicated. Its like an arcade game for kids 5 and under.
918,Anonymous,24-Dec-12,10,"soooooo overrated. This game is repetitive, boring, and frustrating. This game is only popular because it is free and undemanding (in terms of running on computer)."
919,Anonymous,21-Dec-12,10,This is the new king of MOBAS and will remain so for many years to come. The game always gets updated regularly and the devs are the best out there. They always interact with the community and give the players what they want. There is also a bunch of tournament and an enormous e-sport scene for this game which makes it all that much exciting and fun to watch and play.
920,Anonymous,19-Dec-12,0,"Repetitive game-play, horribly imbalanced and homogenized champions and a toxic community. I had more fun watching paint dry than playing this pathetic excuse for a video-game."
921,Anonymous,19-Dec-12,10,"best thing to play for free and best moba for now, also it isn't pay 2 win game, new champions almost every week, patches and fun mod as dominion and worldwide championship."
923,Anonymous,12-Dec-12,10,"I think League of Legends is one of the best free to play online multiplayer games!First time,when I just looked at the game,I thought It's a bit weird,but then I started playing,and I just got to say that It's pretty fun!I can't stop playing it!"
927,Anonymous,07-Dec-12,0,This is one of the worst games I have ever played. Can't believe that so many people waste their time on this crap. Especially with so many wonderful games available.
930,Anonymous,02-Dec-12,9,"Best Moba game ever made.Cons: bad client (crushes often on some PCs), not a friendly community if you are bad they will let you know that but you can mute in-game chat so it's ok.Pros: lots of new champs every month, lots of streamers you can watch and learn, free 2 play, most played game in the world, they make a lot of interesting changes every season."
938,Anonymous,02-Nov-12,7,"It's free and fun. If you need to kill time without spending money, I'd say check it out. If you have a short temper, avoid at all costs. The game relies totally on the players. It's all about teamwork and strategy, and a great majority of the users take the game extremely seriously and will not hesitate to scream at you for any and all mistakes."
940,Anonymous,24-Oct-12,10,"League of Legends is a brilliant MOBA that makes you cooperate with your teammates to defeat the enemy team. Free to play, endless fun, a lot of heroes, great balance, and also one of the most popular games right now. You can spend your money to insta-unlock the heroes or to buy them beautiful and artistic skins."
941,Anonymous,17-Oct-12,10,"Very nice game, easy to learn, pretty funny,  too many champions, etc, The servers run good most of time, copletely free, except if you want skins or boosts.just play and enjoy.solo queue op btw."
943,Anonymous,09-Oct-12,6,"Balancing issues and lack of full content updates make this game frustrating from time to time, Having said that once your time has been put in and you find your champions of choice you can have alot of fun playing, long game times with no alternative makes it ill advised for those who want to hop on a game kill some people in the few minutes they may have to play."
946,Anonymous,04-Sep-12,10,"Great game, based off Warcraft 3's Defense of The Ancients, you pick a champion, and fight with them against players or the computer, very addictive, completely free to play. The graphics are a bit primitive, but who cares? The gameplay is fun."
948,Anonymous,21-Aug-12,9,"League of legends is just a great game. The challenge to unlock all champions just makes the game playable for a long time, instead of some games that have only few unlocks.And its so easy to find a game to participate in, it just takes like 2-3 seconds to find one.The games has his downside, but the game play just makes it all up. So that's why i give League of legends a 9 out of 10."
950,Anonymous,13-Aug-12,5,Fun game but the community makes the experience miserable most of the time.  Teammates excessively bicker and people purposely lose.  Go in with a full team or expect to be frustrated.
951,Anonymous,06-Aug-12,10,"Riot's constantly improving this masterpiece, it deserves way more than a 7.8. There's a reason it's one of the most popular games in the world right now."
952,Anonymous,06-Aug-12,10,"This game has only gotten better and better as the years have passed. Been playing for 3 years already, probably for many more. Thank you Riot for making such an amazing game."
953,Anonymous,05-Aug-12,1,what with this game got good rating i played it i got virtually bored in with 5 mins i thought be like guild wars    but no some kind of game remind me total annihilation old game i had way backbut this game i deleted after 10 mins 5 mins of game play 5 mins later deleting it
956,Anonymous,24-Jul-12,10,very fun and interesting game. There  are players in the game all the time so you are not alone when waiting for a pvp game. As a new comer to this genre it has been really fun..
962,Anonymous,07-Jul-12,5,"The good thing about this Defense of the Ancients based game is that it is newbie friendly compared the other DotA spin-offs. But for the ""Defense of the Ancients elite"" it has little to offer in terms of balance, depth and general skill. For me it's a different version of DotA, based on action and killing rather than teamwork and strategy."
964,Anonymous,01-Jul-12,6,"This game is really easy to learn compared to other ""DotA-like"" games. The game is more chance than skill based which destroys the game experience for me directly. Manipulating games outside of the real gameplay with masteries and runes and expensive Heroes destroys the game for me.I don't think that this game has a capability of being played in e-sports since the games are not 100% even."
965,Anonymous,30-Jun-12,0,This is a very poorly designed game with many balance issues and developers that don't give a **** about anything but making money. That is what this was solely created for; making money. I'd say its money well spent; $10 for a re-texture that changes your hero's color! That's a great price! You're going to have to pay twice as much to get new particle effects!
967,Anonymous,11-Jun-12,9,"It's free..... its freee.... its balanced.... its fun.... ITS FREEE..... oh yeah did I say its free?Its also fun, but its better to have a group of friends to play with."
968,Anonymous,10-Jun-12,4,"This game is too easy and by far the worst DOTA remake of all time. I mean yeah early game and mid game is fun, but late game is just a massive waste of time. It just depends on whether you can kill the whole team in one fell swoop, not items, not carries, not skill, just luck. It is a massive waste of time."
969,Anonymous,05-Jun-12,10,"I love gameplay, fast and fun. it's free to play and if you want you can shop skins for heroes. you can use a lot of heroes for free. Graphics is ok. League of Legends is an amazing game similar Dota."
973,Anonymous,25-May-12,10,This game is excellent. Free to play and have new character from time to time. Never get bored with this game and I definitely recommend this game!!!
977,Anonymous,21-May-12,9,bloody addictive in a great way. as long as you get a good team its about as much fun as you can get. for a newbie to moba games this is a definate first pick.
978,Anonymous,17-May-12,9,"Generally fun and good game, horrible community though. There's a lot of butthurtt, mad, and raging in the game. The game is actually pretty balanced for the most part and this game will eat up most of your time. Possibly the most fun you'll have online."
979,Anonymous,15-May-12,10,"free to play, new characters to play every 2-3 wks. very addictive and fun. Good graphics. Que times are virtually instant. Good teamwork eithics. 10 all the way"
984,Anonymous,14-Apr-12,4,the game was adicting for a few hours but then i figured that it sucks. not as much as fantage because its the worst game ever. legends had okay graphics but bad gameplay
990,Anonymous,21-Mar-12,9,One of the most addicting PC games currently popular League has an active professional scene and support from the developers to constantly improve the gameplay  experience.  The high learning curve may intimidate new players as the tutorial fails to explain key aspects of gameplay. Nevertheless the is a standout that no PC gamers should miss
993,Anonymous,03-Mar-12,10,"this is a really, really fun game. It's multiplayer only, so it's rough if you expect to learn in single player, but it's a lot easier to get into than DOTA, and its a lot less punishing in feel with a much nicer community. Supposedly its very competitive too. I like the faster pace and greater emphasis on team combat compared to DOTA."
994,Anonymous,29-Feb-12,8,"Graphics: 7/10 (not that great, not horrible either)Gameplay: 9/10 (mostly balanced, enjoyable & easy enough to grasp for beginners)Community: 7/10 (common to have dropouts, occasional abuse but still better than HON)overall 8/10"
995,Anonymous,19-Feb-12,7,"best thing to play for free and best moba for now, also it isn't pay 2 win game, new champions almost every week, patches and fun mod as dominion  and worldwide championship."
997,Anonymous,08-Feb-12,5,"Community is utter **** and they treat you worse than **** if you're on the losing side. If you lose too many matches and win too few, you're permanently banned. Unforgiving to newcomers."
998,Anonymous,01-Feb-12,9,"Fun and addictive, this game will eat up a lot of your time. Only drawback is that there are quite a few unbalanced issues in the game. Riot games has been fixing up these issues quite frequently but some champions it seems that riot games favour too much and does not want to nerf making it frustrating for players to see the same champions in every match due to their ""op"" stance."
1000,Anonymous,22-Jan-12,3,Almost every game matched against way stronger opponents. Most of the time they have played tons of more games than myself (100 wins against people with 1000's of wins). Also a solo player does not stand a chance because you will be matched against full premade teams (4-5 players) most of the time. Without friends to play with this is a game that should be skipped.
1005,Anonymous,13-Dec-11,3,"League of Legends, as all other DotA games, fails miserably in balance. If you enjoy real competitive pvp, you will hate this game. If you enjoy mindlessly killing people, you might like this but would in the end be better off buying a singleplayer game."
1007,Anonymous,27-Nov-11,8,Great Game but it has 2 main LacksThe first lack is the balancing. There are about 90 champs now and the more champs riot makes the harder it becomes to balance the game. but they are already releasing new champions instead of focus on balancingthe second thing is the lack of maps (3)
1010,Anonymous,18-Nov-11,10,"League of Legends is a wonderful game with a free-to-play option. If you try it and find out you do not like it, fortunately you didn't have to sacrifice anything but your bandwidth to try it out. It is not a game you can just pick up and expect to be good at. Riot releases new champs frequently and constantly patches to create balances and change the gameplay style up a bit."
1012,Anonymous,13-Nov-11,0,I used to play DoTA all the time and tried LoL several time over the years. The game has stayed the same easy and boring game that it has been. Leveled 3 different accounts to 30 without losing a single game. Riot has made it obvious that they don't care about hero balance. HoN on the otherhand is pretty fun with friends while LoL is just full of trolls and BRs
1022,Anonymous,25-Aug-11,9,"Good game, best MOBA to date. Sometimes it has problems with the servers, but you always get a ""reward"" for your patience- sometimes even in-game currency which you'd usually have to pay for."
1030,Anonymous,13-Jul-11,8,"At first it was a little difficult to grasp the concept of the game. But after jumping into a match with other players, and soon friends, I was instantly grasped by it. While some of the features on the game are somewhat confusing to the leisure gamer, if you spend the time to fully explore everything beneath the surface, you'll find a world of customization at your fingertips."
1035,Anonymous,03-Jul-11,7,"Being a very long member of the LoL community, I would say this game is too heavily reliant on your team (and nothing else). It punishes you more for other teammates' mistakes and less rewarding for your own achievements. But! The premades and friends you make could more than make up for it (maybe...)."
1038,Anonymous,13-Jun-11,10,"One of the few games that I never get tired of. Free to play. Nice graphics, though not great. Superb gameplay. Awesome music. Great leveling system. Currently the best moba on the market."
1043,Anonymous,10-May-11,10,"This game is a freakin' monster. Highly addictive. Riot Games are doing their job very well, up to these days. They introduce a new champion by every two weeks. If you ever enjoyed an AoS style game, then you should try this game. And it's free."
1044,Anonymous,17-Apr-11,10,"Firstly, how can you argue with free. Even if you don't like it, you never had to pay a thing to try it. That doesn't matter though because the game is awesome, fun and easy to play, difficult to master. What more could you really ask for in a game?"
1047,Anonymous,30-Mar-11,0,Probably one of the most boring games I've ever played. Almost fell asleep playing it. I had more fun watching the news. Big waste of my time trying out this game.
1049,Anonymous,18-Mar-11,10,Best played in a competitive nature. Takes some time to get used to mechanics but once you do its fun and you lose hours playing. The game is free and you gain pretty much no advantage spending money on this game. (Unless you count skins as an advantage)
1053,Anonymous,07-Mar-11,8,"Superb, addictive, sociable and fiendishly deep PvP gameplay mechanics flawed by terrible server issues (in Europe at least) game droppers, abusive and cynical community and a buggy engine. Has the potential to be a 10."
1054,Anonymous,05-Mar-11,10,One of the best RTS games in our generation. It is updated regularly and champions added regularly. There are very many champions currently with different ways of play style such as Attack Damage(AD/DPS) Ability Power(AP/Mage) Tank and Support.
1055,Anonymous,23-Jan-11,10,Some critics need need to re-review this game. I've been playing League of Legends since May 2010 and this game has been completely transformed since then. The developers keep the game updated regularly with patches coming out every two weeks to add new content and address bugs and other problems with the game. I highly suggest you try this game out.
1061,Anonymous,01-Sep-10,9,"LoL is a brilliant game that provides a very unique experience to me. Each champion is unique to master, and the battles are always exciting. It's not without it's flaws; it can be frustrating at times, and there are usually balancing issues when new champions and such come out, but the creative team are clearly very dedicated to making the game a fun and challenging experience."
1066,Anonymous,17-Jan-10,5, I guess I'm alone on this but this game is so boring. It's like WoW mechanics just pick a spell pick a bad guy and hope you don't run out of mana/health. The teamwork aspect is nice however doesn't hold enough to spark my interest.
1067,Anonymous,08-Jan-10,10, This game is great! It's absolutely free and the graphic style is unique. The learning curve is great and when you start playing with friends it just gets better! Not to mention the friendly comunity and fun atmosphere.
1069,Anonymous,30-Dec-09,6," lets be fair, lol is far from being a game, its just a mod, nothing special about it, the engine is bad since it consumes many resourses. besides, the game is... kinda expensive for a game"
1070,Anonymous,15-Dec-09,10, I love this game - haven't spent so many hours playing a game since WOW first came out. Hugely replayable and extremely fun.
1071,Anonymous,15-Dec-09,10," game created by the same person who developed Dota, meaning, successor to Dota. This game is full of fun and gets quite addictive. Although, losing may be frustrating sometimes, it hooks you into the game, and you'll never be able to let go of this."
1072,Anonymous,07-Dec-09,10, Big shoes to fill? Bah! This successor to DotA definitely walks proud in daddy's giant boots.
1075,Anonymous,19-Nov-09,10, It's the DOTA variation that we all dreamed about. The f automatic match making based on ELO easy interface and reconnection possibility and a penalizing system for those cheaters and leavers... ETC. And to top it off it has really unique set of heroes and a complex combination of masteries and runes that you can use to come up with your own combo.
1076,Anonymous,10-Nov-09,10, This is one of the best games I have ever played - I haven't been so addicted to a game since I first played World of Warcraft! I can't stop playing and it's a ton of fun.
1077,Anonymous,09-Nov-09,10," Among free titles, this is truly the best. The champions are well-diversified, the matches are intense, and the combat is satisfying. Truly, this game is ""leagues"" above the other ""legends"" such as Heroes of Newerth or DOTA."
1078,Anonymous,07-Nov-09,10," Awesome game, I've been in the beta since August. It is a little rough around the edges right now, and balance needs some work, but its a free game! So I definitely recommend checking it out. Riot is one of the best developers I've ever seen, they respond to a ton of feedback and get stuff fixed quickly."
1080,Anonymous,05-Nov-09,10," this game is loads of fun. no game is ever the same, and i am looking forward to the new maps that they are working on, as well as the new champs that will be out!"
1081,Anonymous,05-Nov-09,10, An excellent game with an excellent staff. Would recommend this to anybody looking for a fun time or casually gaming at a LAN party :).
1082,Anonymous,04-Nov-09,3," The same unbalanced unfair gameplay that made dota so horrible. They improved on the item system, but the rest is still the same old dota failure. Levels and itms have no place in fair competitive pvp combat!"
1083,Anonymous,02-Nov-09,10," Fun champions, a less steep learning curve than DOTA, a great online community and a development team that actually listen to their players make this a game not to be missed!"
1084,Anonymous,29-Oct-09,10," Awesome game! Free to play, 40 champions to choose from, live service continually making the game better... what else could you ask for. Love it!"
1085,Anonymous,29-Oct-09,10," Best MOBA out there. I came from DOTA, and I also tried HON, but this game really proves itself over and over to be the best MOBA out there. And it's free."
1086,Anonymous,28-Oct-09,10," I think this game is really addictive so far. I like it a lot more than the competitor game Heroes of Newerth and Dota. They have tons of original heroes, and a lot of long term goals for the game. It looks really promising. They're pretty strict in enforcing language and behavioral issues, so make sure to not use any racial slurs or stuff like that! Go Riot ! :D"
1087,Anonymous,28-Oct-09,10," This game will really go far. Once you get into it, it hooks you! It also has a ton of potential and I can't wait to see it grow!"
1088,Anonymous,28-Oct-09,10," I love this game. I could never get into DOTA, or HON, but for some reason unknown to me, LoL caught my attention. There is a very high level of player skill involved in the late game, and in addition to that, there is also a very highly competitive nature at that level. I have a lot of friends who played dota. I am very happy to say that I can now play LoL with them!"
1090,Anonymous,27-Oct-09,10," this is a really, really fun game. It's multiplayer only, so it's rough if you expect to learn in single player, but it's a lot easier to get into than DOTA, and its a lot less punishing in feel with a much nicer community. Supposedly its very competitive too. I like the faster pace and greater emphasis on team combat compared to DOTA."
1091,Anonymous,27-Oct-09,10," This is an outstanding, deep, and polished game in a fledgling new genre. It may not be for everyone, but for those who enjoy pvp and strategy, this might be your GOTY!"
